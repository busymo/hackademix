transform programming education. To pinpoint the current state of research on using LLM-based code generators to support the teaching and learning of programming, we conducted a systematic literature review of 21 papers published since 2018. The review focuses on (1) the teaching and learning practices in programming education that utilized LLM-based code generation models, (2) characteristics and (3) performance indicators of the models, and (4) aspects to consider when utilizing the models in programming education, including the risks and challenges. We found that the most commonly reported uses of LLM-based code generation models for teachers are generating assignments and evaluating student work, while for students, the models function as virtual tutors. We identified that the models exhibit accuracy limitations; generated content often contains minor errors that are manageable by instructors but pose risks for novice learners. Moreover, risks such as academic misconduct and over-reliance on the models are critical when considering integrating these models into education. Overall, LLM-based code generation models can be an assistive tool for both learners and instructors if the risks are mitigated.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1145/3626252.3630958","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Doga","last_name":"Cambaz","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":[]},{"first_name":"Xiaoling","last_name":"Zhang","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":0,"keywords":[]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":0,"location":null,"raw_text":"Cambaz, D.; Zhang, X.

A Rapid Review of the Literature","abstract":[{"text":"An artificial intelligence-based chatbot, ChatGPT, was launched in November 2022 and is capable of generating cohesive and informative human-like responses to user input. This rapid review of the literature aims to enrich our understanding of ChatGPTs capabilities across subject domains, how it can be used in education, and potential issues raised by researchers during the first three months of its release (i.e., December 2022 to February 2023). A search of the relevant databases and Google Scholar yielded 50 articles for content analysis (i.e., open coding, axial coding, and selective coding). The findings of this review suggest that ChatGPTs performance varied across subject domains, ranging from outstanding (e.g., economics) and satisfactory (e.g., programming) to unsatisfactory (e.g., mathematics). Although ChatGPT has the potential to serve as an assistant for instructors (e.g., to generate course materials and provide suggestions) and a virtual tutor for students (e.g., to answer questions and facilitate collaboration), there were challenges associated with its use (e.g., generating incorrect or fake information and bypassing plagiarism detectors). Immediate action should be taken to update the assessment methods and institutional policies in schools and universities. Instructor training and student education are also essential to respond to the impact of ChatGPT on the educational environment.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/educsci13040410","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Chung Kwan","last_name":"Lo","affiliations":[],"email":"chungkwanlo@eduhk.hk","orcid":"","h_index":15,"keywords":["Flipped classroom","Inverted classroom","Pedagogical issues","Secondary education","NGSS","flipped learning","science education","Mathematics education","Statistics education","Teaching approach","classroom","chapter","lighlights","rationale","Reviews on Flipped","systematic reviews","conducting systematic","achievement","meta‐analysis","systematic review","literature review","flipped","pandemic","Mdn","COVID","mathematics","secondary","pre","quizzes","Kahoot","COVID-19","Chatbot","Technology-Enhanced Learning","Video-recorded lectures","video styles","worked answers","recall","application","gamification-enhanced","behavioral engagement","cognitive engagement","higher education setting","bias","credible","behavioral","flipped classroom meta analyses","Computational thinking","Activity design","Early childhood education","Preschoolers","online instruction","classes suspension","linear algebra","instructional materials","recursive instructional design","open education resources","Visual learning analytics","Teacher-student interactions","Productive classroom talk","Professional development","formative assessment","ChatGPT","OpenAI","artificial intelligence","natural language processing","design‐based research","self‐determination theory","student engagement","Student Achievement","Student Attitude","Instructional Approach","Operational Challenge","Educational technology","online learning","gamification","remote teaching","student perception","qualitative study","self-determination theory","business education","adult learning","mathematical modeling","modeling activity","STEM education","online flipped classroom","postgraduate education","open educational resources","primary education","techno-pedagogy","action research","adult education","post-COVID-19","virtual reality","Class preparation","Student learning","Cognitive load","Experimental study"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":4,"location":null,"raw_text":"Lo, C.K.

Since June 2022, Copilot has officially been available for free to all students as a plug-in to development environments like Visual Studio Code. Prior work exploring OpenAI Codex, the underlying model that powers Copilot, has shown it performs well on typical CS1 problems thus raising concerns about its potential impact on how introductory programming courses are taught. However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill

Existing traditional assistants are no longer up to all the developers challenges. Traditional assistants usually present proposals in alphabetically sorted lists, which does not make a developers tasks any easier (i.e., they still have to search and filter an appropriate proposal manually). As a possible solution to the presented issue, intelligent assistants that can classify suggestions according to relevance in particular contexts have emerged. Artificial intelligence methods have proven to be successful in solving such problems. Advanced intelligent assistants not only take into account the context of a particular source code but also, more importantly, examine other available projects in detail to extract possible patterns related to particular source code intentions. This is how intelligent assistants try to provide developers with relevant suggestions. By conducting a systematic literature review, we examined the current intelligent assistant landscape. Based on our review, we tested four intelligent assistants and compared them according to their functionality. GitHub Copilot, which stood out, allows suggestions in the form of complete source code sections. One would expect that intelligent assistants, with their outstanding functionalities, would be one of the most popular helpers in a developers toolbox. However, through a survey we conducted among practitioners, the results, surprisingly, contradicted this idea. Although intelligent assistants promise high usability, our questionnaires indicate that usability improvements are still needed. However, our research data show that experienced developers value intelligent assistants highly, highlighting their significant utility for the experienced developers group when compared to less experienced individuals. The unexpectedly low net promoter score (NPS) for intelligent code assistants in our study was quite surprising, highlighting a stark contrast between the anticipated impact of these advanced tools and their actual reception among developers.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/app132413061","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tilen","last_name":"Hliš","affiliations":[],"email":"tilen.hlis@um.si","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["kot","Functions","na vseh","arhitekture uporabljamo","temveč praktično","preizkušene ideje","dobre prakse","praksa na","technical debt identification","self-admitted technical debt","technical debt measurement","difference comparison","intelligent assistants","source code completion","source code"]},{"first_name":"Luka","last_name":"Četina","affiliations":[],"email":"luka.cetina@um.si","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":[]},{"first_name":"Tina","last_name":"Beranič","affiliations":[],"email":"tina.beranic@um.si","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["Distant learning","Assessment patterns","Evaluation practices","knowledge assessment","best practices","distance learning","online learning","students’ satisfaction","popularity","Gamification","Gamification in higher education","ERPsim","System usability","System Usability Scale","Knowledge acquisition","ERP system","Business simulation game","ERP course","software quality","software metrics","metric thresholds","object-oriented","smells in source code","smelling entities","reliable identification","majority function","expert judgment","information technology","higher education","experiential learning","simulation game","ERP systems","usability","SUS","SAP","business simulation","course engagement","machine learning","software maintainability","maintainability index","maintainability prediction","history of software releases","digitalization","digitalization index","SME","small and medium-sized enterprises","value chain","natural fiber","sustainability","Industry 4.0","comparative study","performing experiments","source code quality","student participants","technical debt identification","self-admitted technical debt","technical debt measurement","difference comparison","intelligent assistants","source code completion","source code","Distance education and online learning","Improving classroom teaching","Pedagogical issues","Teacher professional development","Post-secondary educations"]},{"first_name":"Luka","last_name":"Pavlič","affiliations":[],"email":"luka.pavlic@um.si","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["algorithms","ontologies","design patterns","entropy","selection algorithm","software engineering","Software product line","Android","Simultaneous development","iOS","Software quality","Software product editions","Agile software development","Agile Coaching","Agile adoption","ICT support","KM support","Distant learning","Assessment patterns","Evaluation practices","knowledge assessment","best practices","distance learning","online learning","students’ satisfaction","popularity","Digital storytelling pipeline","Data warehousing","3D reconstruction","Lidar","comparative study","expert judgment","performing experiments","source code quality","student participants","technical debt identification","self-admitted technical debt","technical debt measurement","difference comparison","intelligent assistants","source code completion","source code","SAFe","scaled agile framework","artificial intelligence","tools","assistants","agile","large-scale","Distance education and online learning","Improving classroom teaching","Pedagogical issues","Teacher professional development","Post-secondary educations","kot","Functions","na vseh","arhitekture uporabljamo","temveč praktično","preizkušene ideje","dobre prakse","praksa na","tehnologij","informatike","OTS","ne samo","kot četrt","se jih","skozi prizmo","izkunje","skozi","srečujemo","React","inovativne","upravljalci","ter","arhitekti","knjižnici","strokovne"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":12,"location":null,"raw_text":"Hliš, T.; Četina, L.; Beranič, T.; Pavlič, L.

For that, we analyzed the computational resources of AI- and human-generated program code using metrics such as time and space complexity as well as runtime and memory usage. Additionally, we evaluated the maintainability using metrics such as lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, Halstead complexity and maintainability index. For our experiments, we had generative AIs produce program code in Java, Python, and C++ that solves problems defined on the competition coding website leetcode.com. We selected six LeetCode problems of varying difficulty, resulting in 18 program codes generated by each generative AI. GitHub Copilot, powered by Codex (GPT-3.0), performed best, solving 9 of the 18 problems (50.0%), whereas CodeWhisperer did not solve a single problem. BingAI Chat (GPT-4.0) generated correct program code for seven problems (38.9%), ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and Code Llama (Llama 2) for four problems (22.2%) and StarCoder and InstructCodeT5+ for only one problem (5.6%). Surprisingly, although ChatGPT generated only four correct program codes, it was the only generative AI capable of providing a correct solution to a coding problem of difficulty level hard. In summary, 26 AI-generated codes (20.6%) solve the respective problem. For 11 AI-generated incorrect codes (8.7%), only minimal modifications to the program code are necessary to solve the problem, which results in time savings between 8.9% and even 71.3% in comparison to programming the program code from scratch.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/a17020062","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Baskhad","last_name":"Idrisov","affiliations":[],"email":"baskhad.idrisov@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":[]},{"first_name":"Tim","last_name":"Schlippe","affiliations":[],"email":"tim.schlippe@iu.org","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["Artificial intelligence in education","Cross-lingual short answer grading","Conversational AI","Keyword extraction","Natural language processing","AI art","AI in Art","Painting","Semantic Segmentation","Semantic Labeling","Machine Learning","Automatic short answer grading","Deep learning","Cross-lingual automatic short answer grading","AI in education","Recommender system","Recommendation system","Up-skilling","Upskilling","Recommender systems","Clustering","AI for Social Good","Sentiment Analysis","South Africa","Closed captions","Subtitles","Speech processing","Digital humanities","Explainability","Explainable AI","XAI","Akuapem Twi","machine translation","low-resource language","Twi–French"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":13,"location":null,"raw_text":"Idrisov, B.; Schlippe, T.
