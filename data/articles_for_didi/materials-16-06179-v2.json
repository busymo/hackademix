In the work described in this article, we tested so-called multiridge-based analysis, based on the crazy climber algorithm and short-time Fourier transform, for assessment of the FFGW component recorded by a clinical array transducer featuring a limited number of elements. Methods included numerical finite-element simulations and experiments in bone phantoms and human radius specimens (n = 41). The proposed approach enabled extraction of the FFGW component and determination of its group velocity. This group velocity was in good agreement with theoretical predictions and possessed reasonable sensitivity to cortical width (r(2) = 0.51, p < 0.001) in the in vitro experiments. It is expected that the proposed approach enables related clinical application. Further work is still needed to analyze in more detail the challenges related to the impact of the overlying soft tissue.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2013.02.002","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Vantte","last_name":"Kilappa","affiliations":[],"email":"warma@iki.fi","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["Axial

The condition of cortical bones and the development of osteoporosis are determined by numerous mechanical, micro-structural, and geometrical or macro-structural bone properties like hardness, porosity and cortical thickness. Such complex manifestations of osteoporosis require the evaluation of multiple parameters with different sensitivities to the various properties of bone that are affected by the disease. This objective may be achieved by using a multi-frequency ultrasonic examination The ratio of the acoustic wavelength to the cortical thickness can be changed by varying the frequency of the ultrasonic pulse propagating through the long bone that results in the change in composition of the induced wave comprised of a set of numerous modes of guided, longitudinal, and surface acoustic waves. The multi-frequency axial transmission QUS method developed at Artann Laboratories (Trenton, NJ) is implemented in the Bone Ultrasonic Scanner (BUSS). In the current version of the BUSS, a train of ultrasonic pulses with 60, 100, 400, 800, and 1200 kHz frequencies is used. The developed technology was tested on a variety of bone phantoms simulating normal, osteopenic, and osteoporotic bones. The results of this study confirm the feasibility of the multi-frequency approach for the assessment of the processes leading to osteoporosis.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultras.2013.09.025","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Aleksejs","last_name":"Tatarinovs","affiliations":[],"email":"alta2003@apollo.lv","orcid":"","h_index":3,"keywords":["Bone quantitative ultrasound","Multi-frequency axial transmission scanner","Osteoporosis","Long-range ultrasonic testing (LRUT)","Torsional wave (T-wave)","Longitudinal wave (L-wave)","Corrosion","Modeling","Magnetostrictive transducers","timber-concrete composite","wood-concrete composite","adhesive connection","ultrasonic testing","operational modal analysis","cross-laminated timber","rigid connection","non-destructive testing method","composite bone phantoms","guided wave modal excitability","restoration of effective elastic moduli","resonance diagnostics"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":6,"location":null,"raw_text":"Tatarinov, A.; Egorov, V.; Sarvazyan, N.; Sarvazyan, A.

Clinical applications remain, however, challenging, as the impact of soft tissue on guided waves characteristics is not fully understood yet. In particular, it must be clarified whether soft tissue must be incorporated in waveguide models needed to infer reliable cortical bone properties. We hypothesize that an inverse procedure using a free plate model can be applied to retrieve the thickness and stiffness of cortical bone from experimental data. This approach is first validated on a series of laboratory-controlled measurements performed on assemblies of bone- and soft tissue mimicking phantoms and then onin vivomeasurements. The accuracy of the estimates is evaluated by comparison with reference values. To further support our hypothesis, these estimates are subsequently inserted into a bilayer model to test its accuracy. Our results show that the free plate model allows retrieving reliable waveguide properties, despite the presence of soft tissue. They also suggest that the more sophisticated bilayer model, although it is more precise to predict experimental data in the forward problem, could turn out to be hardly manageable for solving the inverse problem.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1038/srep43628","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Bochud","affiliations":[],"email":"nicolas.bochud@u-pec.fr","orcid":"","h_index":11,"keywords":["Multiscale

However, the signal interpretation is challenging due to multiple mode overlapping. To overcome this limitation, dry point-contact transducers have been used at low frequencies for a selective excitation of the zeroth order anti-symmetric Lamb A0 mode, a mode whose dispersion characteristics can be used to infer the thickness of the waveguide. In this paper, our purpose was to extend the technique by combining a dry point-contact transducers approach to the SVD-enhanced 2-D Fourier transform in order to measure the dispersion characteristics of the flexural mode. The robustness of our approach is assessed on bone-mimicking phantoms covered or not with soft tissue-mimicking layer. Experiments were also performed on a bovine bone. Dispersion characteristics of measured modes were extracted using a SVD-based signal processing technique. The thickness was obtained by fitting a free plate model to experimental data. The results show that, in all studied cases, the estimated thickness values are in good agreement with the actual thickness values. From the results, we speculate that in vivo cortical thickness assessment by measuring the flexural wave using point-contact transducers is feasible. However, this assumption has to be confirmed by further in vivo studies.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultras.2017.05.008","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Koussila","last_name":"Kassou","affiliations":[],"email":"kkassou@usthb.dz","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Axial

[PubMed]"},{"referenced_article":{"title":"Bone cortical thickness and porosity assessment using ultrasound guided waves: An ex vivo validation study","abstract":[{"text":"Several studies showed the ability of the cortex of long bones such as the radius and tibia to guide mechanical waves. Such experimental evidence has given rise to the emergence of a category of quantitative ultrasound techniques, referred to as the axial transmission, specifically developed to measure the propagation of ultrasound guided waves in the cortical shell along the axis of long bones. An ultrasound axial transmission technique, with an automated approach to quantify cortical thickness and porosity is described. The guided modes propagating in the cortex are recorded with a 1-MHz custom made linear transducer array. Measurement of the dispersion curves is achieved using a two-dimensional spatio-temporal Fourier transform combined with singular value decomposition. Automatic parameters identification is obtained through the solution of an inverse problem in which the dispersion curves are predicted with a two-dimensional transverse isotropic free plate model. Thirty-one radii and fifteen tibiae harvested from human cadavers underwent axial transmission measurements. Estimates of cortical thickness and porosity were obtained on 40 samples out of 46. The reproducibility, given by the root mean square error of the standard deviation of estimates, was 0.11 mm for thickness and 1.9% for porosity. To assess accuracy, site-matched micro-computed tomography images of the bone specimens imaged at 9 mu m voxel size served as the gold standard. Agreement between micro-computed tomography and axial transmission for quantification of thickness and porosity at the radius and tibia ranged from R-2=0.63 for porosity (root mean square error RMSE =1.8%) to 0.89 for thickness (RMSE = 0.3 mm). Despite an overall good agreement for porosity, the method performs less well for porosities lower than 10%. The heterogeneity and general complexity of cortical bone structure, which are not fully accounted for by our model, are suspected to weaken the model approximation. This study presents the first validation study for assessing cortical thickness and porosity using the axial transmission technique. The automatic signal processing minimizes operator-dependent errors for parameters determination. Recovering the waveguide characteristics, that is to say cortical thickness and porosity, could provide reliable information about skeletal status and future fracture risk.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.bone.2018.07.018","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jean-Gabriel","last_name":"Minonzio","affiliations":[],"email":"jean-gabriel.minonzio@upmc.fr","orcid":"","h_index":21,"keywords":["Velocity

In this study, the effect arising from soft tissues on propagation characteristics of guided ultrasound waves in bones was investigated using tubular Sawbones phantoms covered with a layer of mimicked soft tissue of different thicknesses and elastic moduli, and an in vitro porcine femur in terms of the axial transmission measurement. Results revealed that presence of soft tissues can exert significant influence on the propagation of ultrasound waves in bones, leading to reduced propagation velocities and attenuated wave magnitudes compared with the counterparts in a free bone in the absence of soft tissues. However such an effect is not phenomenally dependent on the variations in thickness and elastic modulus of the coupled soft tissues, making it possible to compensate for the coupling effect regardless of the difference in properties of the soft tissues. Based on an in vitro calibration, this study proposed quantitative compensation for the effect of soft tissues on ultrasound waves in bones, facilitating development of high-precision QUS.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultras.2013.08.002","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Zhongqing","last_name":"Su","affiliations":[],"email":"zhongqing.su@polyu.edu.hk","orcid":"","h_index":44,"keywords":["Fatigue crack","Non-penetrating crack","Structural health monitoring","Contact acoustic nonlinearity","Crack growth","Mechanical engineering","A.

The group velocity of the time-reversed Lamb wave showed significant positive correlations with the bone properties (r=0.55-0.81). The best univariate predictor of the group velocity of the time-reversed Lamb wave was the cortical thickness, yielding an adjusted squared correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.64.

However, understanding the interaction between ultrasonic guided waves and the cortical bone structure remains challenging. The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of intracortical bone properties on the ultrasonic response obtained at low-frequency (<100 kHz) using an axial transmission configuration. The semi-analytical finite element method was used to simulate the propagation of guided waves in a waveguide with realistic geometry and material properties. An array of 20 receivers was used to calculate the phase velocity and cut-off frequency of the excited modes using the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The results show that the position of the emitter around the circumference of the bone is an important parameter to control since it can lead to variations of up to 10 dB in the amplitude of the transmitted modes. The cut-off frequency of the high order modes was, however, only slightly affected by the circumferential position of the emitter, and was sensitive mainly to the axial shear modulus. The phase velocity and cut-off frequency in the 2085 kHz range are promising parameters for the assessment of intracortical properties.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1121/1.5084731","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Pereira","affiliations":[],"email":"daniel.pereira.1@ens.etsmtl.ca","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":[]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":13,"location":null,"raw_text":"Pereira, D.; Haïat, G.; Fernandes, J.; Belanger, P.

The inversion scheme is formulated in the dispersive frequency-phase velocity domain to recover bone properties. The method uses ultrasonic guided waves to retrieve overlying soft tissue thickness, cortical thickness, compressional, and shear-wave velocities of the cortex. The inversion strategy requires systematic examination of a large set of trial dispersion-curve solutions within a pre-defined model space to match the data with minimum cost in a least-squares sense. The theoretical dispersion curves required to solve the inverse problem are computed for bilayered bone models using a semi-analytical finite-element method. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated by the numerically simulated data for a 1 mm soft tissue-5 mm bone bilayer and ex-vivo data from a bovine femur plate with an overlying 2 mm-thick soft-tissue mimic. The bootstrap method was employed to evaluate the inversion uncertainty and stability.

The assessment of cortical parameters based on full-spectrum guided-wave analysis might improve the prediction of bone fractures in a cost-effective and radiation-free manner. Purpose Cortical thickness (Ct.Th) and porosity (Ct.Po) are key parameters for the identification of patients with fragile bones. The main objective of this ex vivo study was to validate the measurement of Ct.Po and Ct.Th at the tibia using a non-ionizing, low-cost, and portable 500-kHz ultrasound axial transmission system. Additional ultrasonic velocities and site-matched reference parameters were included in the study to broaden the analysis. Methods Guided waves were successfully measured ex vivo in 17 human tibiae using a novel 500-kHz bi-directional axial transmission probe. Theoretical dispersion curves of a transverse isotropic free plate model with invariant matrix stiffness were fitted to the experimental dispersion curves in order to estimate Ct.Th and Ct.Po. In addition, the velocities of the first arriving signal (υFAS) and A0 mode (υA0) were measured. Reference Ct.Po, Ct.Th, and vBMD were obtained from site-matched micro-computed tomography. Scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) provided the acoustic impedance of the axial cortical bone matrix. Results The best predictions of Ct.Po (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 2.2%) and Ct.Th (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.2 mm, one outlier excluded) were obtained from the plate model. The second best predictors of Ct.Po and Ct.Th were vBMD (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.6%) and υA0 (R2 = 0.28, RMSE = 0.67 mm), respectively. Conclusions Ct.Th and Ct.Po were accurately predicted at the human tibia ex vivo using a transverse isotropic free plate model with invariant matrix stiffness. The model-based predictions were not further enhanced when we accounted for variations in axial tissue stiffness as reflected by the acoustic impedance from SAM.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s11657-019-0578-1","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Johannes","last_name":"Schneider","affiliations":[],"email":"johannes.schneider@charite.de","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Acoustic

These modes are efficiently generated in a parietal region by direct contact excitation with a wedge beam transducer, and are recorded via infrared laser vibrometry. Frequency/wavenumber data are estimated using a matrix pencil method applied to wavefield measurements recorded on the outer cortical surface. The semi-analytical finite element model of an equivalent three-layered plate provides the platform for the identification of wave modes based on their through-the-thickness profiles, and supports the estimation of equivalent mechanical properties in conjunction with an optimization algorithm developed for this purpose.

To overcome this obstacle, a classic idea is to separate individual modes and to extract the corresponding dispersion curves. Reported single-channel mode separation algorithms mainly focused on offering a time-frequency representation (TFR) where the energy distributions of individual modes were apart from each other. However, such approaches are still limited to identifying the modes without significant overlapping in time-frequency domain. In this study, a spectrogram decomposition technique was developed based on a combination strategy of generalized separable nonnegative matrix factorization (GS-NMF) and adaptive basis learning, towards the automatic mode extraction under severe overlapping and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The extracted modes were further used for cortical thickness estimation. The method was verified using broadband simulated and experimental datasets. Experiments were conducted on a bone-mimicking plate and bovine cortical bone plates. For simulated data, the relative errors between extracted and theoretical dispersion curves are 1.33% (SNR = infinity), 1.43% (SNR = 10 dB) and 0.88% (SNR = 5 dB). The root-mean-square errors of the estimated thickness for 3.10 mm-thick bone-mimicking plate, 3.83 mm-and 4.00 mm-thick bovine cortical bone plates are 0.039 mm, 0.049 mm, and 0.052 mm, respectively. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of separating multimodal UGWs even under significantly overlapping and low SNR conditions, further facilitating the UGW-based cortical thickness assessment.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultras.2021.106665","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Kailiang","last_name":"Xu","affiliations":[],"email":"xukl@fudan.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":15,"keywords":["CORTICAL

Purpose To improve the accuracy of the previously proposed technique of free water T1 quantification and to seek the relationship between cortical bone free water T1 and its mechanical competence. Study Type Prospective. Subjects Twenty samples of bovine tibia bone. Field Strength/Sequences 3.0 T; ultra-fast two-dimensional gradient echo, Radio frequency-spoiled three-dimensional gradient echo. Assessment Cortical bone free water T1 was quantified via three different methods: inversion recovery (IR), variable flip angle (VFA), and variable repetition time (VTR). Signal-to-noise ratio was measured by dividing the signal of each segmented sample to background noise. Segmentation was done manually. The effect of noise on T1 quantification was evaluated. Then, the samples were subjected to mechanical compression test to measure the toughness, yield stress, ultimate stress, and Young modulus. Statistical Tests All the statistical analysis (ShapiroWilk, way analysis of variance, paired t test, Pearson correlation, and BlandAltman plot) were done using SPSS. Results Significant difference was found between T1 quantification groups (P < 0.05). Average T1 of each quantification method differed significantly after adding noise (P < 0.05). VFA-T1 values significantly correlated with toughness (r = 0.68, P < 0.05), ultimate stress (r = 0.71, P < 0.05), and yield stress (r = 0.62, P < 0.05). No significant correlation was found between VTR-T1 values and toughness (P = 0.07), ultimate stress (P = 0.47), yield stress (P = 0.30), and Young modulus (P = 0.39). Data Conclusion Pore water T1 value is associated with bone mechanical competence, and VFA method employing short-TE pulse sequence seems a superior technique to VTR method for this quantification.

A new ultrasound method for primary health care is proposed. Results suggest applicability of ultrasound method for osteoporosis diagnostics at primary health care. Introduction We lack effective screening and diagnostics of osteoporosis at primary health care. In this study, a new ultrasound (US) method is proposed for osteoporosis diagnostics. Methods A total of 572 Caucasian women (age 20 to 91 years) were examined using pulse-echo US measurements in the tibia and radius. This method provides an estimate of bone mineral density (BMD), i.e. density index (DI). Areal BMD measurements at the femoral neck (BMDneck) and total hip (BMDtotal) were determined by using axial dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for women older than 50 years of age (n = 445, age = 68.8 ± 8.5 years). The osteoporosis thresholds for the DI were determined according to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD). Finally, the FRAX questionnaire was completed by 425 participants. Results Osteoporosis was diagnosed in individuals with a T-score 2.5 or less in the total hip or femoral neck (n = 75). By using the ISCD approach for the DI, only 28.7 % of the subjects were found to require an additional DXA measurement. Our results suggest that combination of US measurement and FRAX in osteoporosis management pathways would decrease the number of DXA measurements to 16 % and the same treatment decisions would be reached at 85.4 % sensitivity and 78.5 % specificity levels. Conclusions The present results demonstrate a significant correlation between the ultrasound and DXA measurements at the proximal femur. The thresholds presented here with the application to current osteoporosis management pathways show promise for the technique to significantly decrease the amount of DXA referrals and increase diagnostic coverage; however, these results need to be confirmed in future studies.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s00198-015-3387-4","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Janne

This numerical study takes advantage of ultrasound multiple scattering in cortical bone to investigate the effect of pore size and pore density on the acoustic diffusion constant. Finite-difference time-domain simulations were conducted in cortical microstructures that were derived from acoustic microscopy images of human proximal femur cross sections and modified by controlling the density (Ct.Po.Dn)  [ 5  25 ] p ore / m m 2 and size (Ct.Po.Dm)  [ 30  100 ] μ m of the pores. Gaussian pulses were transmitted through the medium and the backscattered signals were recorded to obtain the backscattered intensity. The incoherent contribution of the backscattered intensity was extracted to give access to the diffusion constant D. At 8 MHz, significant differences in the diffusion constant were observed in media with different porous micro-architectures.

The goal of this work was to investigate changes in spatial distribution and microstructure of cortical porosity associated with aging in men and women. The specific aims were to: 1) develop an automated technique for spatial analysis of cortical microstructure based on HR-pQCT data, and; 2) apply this technique to explore sex- and age-specific spatial distribution and microstructure of porosity within the cortex. We evaluated HR-pQCT images of the distal tibia from a cross-sectional cohort of 145 individuals, characterizing detectable pores as being in the endosteal, midcortical, or periosteal layers of the cortex. Metrics describing porosity, pore number, and pore size were quantified within each layer and compared across sexes, age groups, and cortical layers. The elderly cohort (6578 years, n = 22) displayed higher values than the young cohort (2029 years, n = 29) for all parameters both globally and within each layer. While all three layers displayed significant age-related porosity increases, the greatest difference in porosity between the young and elderly cohort was in the midcortical layer (+ 344%, p < 0.001). Similarly, the midcortical layer reflected the greatest differences between young and elderly cohorts in both pore number (+ 243%, p < 0.001) and size (+ 28%, p < 0.001). Females displayed greater age-related changes in porosity and pore number than males. Females and males displayed comparable small to non-significant changes with age in pore size. In summary, considerable variability exists in the spatial distribution of detectable cortical porosity at the distal tibia, and this variability is dependent on age and sex. Intracortical pore distribution analysis may ultimately provide insight into both mechanisms of pore network expansion and biomechanical consequences of pore distribution.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.bone.2015.02.006","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jasmine

Explicit and asymptotic expressions for guided waves generated by a given source are then obtained from those integrals by means of series expansions and the residue technique. Unlike to conventional modal expansions, such representations keep information about the source, giving an opportunity for a quantitative near- and far-field analysis of generated waves. An effective computer implementation is achieved by the use of fast and stable algorithms for the Green matrix, pole, and residue calculations. The potential of the model is demonstrated by examples of anisotropy manifestation in the directivity of radiated waves.

Comparison of the gradient and multilayer models shows that with a high enough number of partitions (layers), the dispersion properties and amplitude-frequency characteristics of surface waves in FGMs are described by the curves obtained upon a steplike approximation of gradient properties; however, with high contrast properties, the multilayer model can be more time-consuming.

This method relies on the measurements of multimode guided waves, which are launched and detected in arbitrary directions along the plate using a multi-element linear transducer array driven by a programmable electronic device. A model-based inverse problem solution is proposed to optimally recover the properties of interest. The main contribution consists in defining an objective function built from the dispersion equation, which allows accounting for higher-order modes without the need to pair each experimental data point to a specific guided mode. This avoids the numerical calculation of the dispersion curves and errors in the mode identification. Compared to standard root-finding algorithms, the computational gain of the procedure is estimated to be on the order of 200. The objective function is optimized using genetic algorithms, which allow identifying from a single out-of-symmetry axis measurement the full set of anisotropic elastic coefficients and either the plate thickness or the propagation direction. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using data measured on materials with different symmetry classes. Excellent agreement is found between the reported estimates and reference values from the literature.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1121/1.5024353","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nicolas","last_name":"Bochud","affiliations":[],"email":"nicolas.bochud@u-pec.fr","orcid":"","h_index":11,"keywords":["Multiscale

The results are obtained from finite element time domain simulations together with experimental measurements. Good agreement is found between the simulations and the measurements. Results are shown for a range of notch widths and depths, including the special case of a crack, defined as a zero-width notch. The reflection coefficient, when plotted as a function of the notch width, exhibits a cosinusoidal periodic shape, and this is explained by interference between the separate reflections from the start and the end of the notch. The reflection coefficient, when plotted as a function of notch depth, shows that in general the reflection increases with both frequency and notch depth, but the shapes of the functions are complex and there are some surprising features. An analysis of the reflection from cracks using the S-parameter scattering approach and some simplified descriptions of the crack-opening behavior yields physical explanations of the nature of these reflection functions. It is found that opening of the crack can be described adequately by a quasistatic assumption only when the crack is small, and in other cases a ray theory approach is more representative. The reflection function is shown to be a result of contributions from both the axial stress and the shear stress in the wave, and the relative importance of these varies with the crack depth and the frequency.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1121/1.1512702","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Michael J.

Recently, an approach based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of multidimensional signals recorded with an axial transmission array of emitters and receivers has been proposed for materials with negligible absorption, see Minonzio et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 127, 29132919 (2010)]. In presence of absorption, the ability to extract guided mode degrades. The objective of the present study is to extend the method to the case of absorbing media, considering attenuated plane waves (complex wavenumber). The guided mode wavenumber extraction is enhanced and the order of magnitude of the attenuation of the guided mode is estimated. Experiments have been carried out on 2 mm thick plates in the 0.22 MHz bandwidth. Two materials are inspected: polymethylacrylate (PMMA) (isotropic with absorption) and artificial composite bones (Sawbones, Pacific Research Laboratory Inc, Vashon, WA) which is a transverse isotropic absorbing medium. Bulk wave velocities and bulk attenuation have been evaluated from transmission measurements. These values were used to compute theoretical Lamb mode wavenumbers which are consistent with the experimental ones obtained with the SVD-based approach.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1121/1.3652884","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jean-Gabriel","last_name":"Minonzio","affiliations":[],"email":"jean-gabriel.minonzio@upmc.fr","orcid":"","h_index":21,"keywords":["Velocity

Decreased cortical thickness (Ct.Th) and the prevalence of large pores at the tibia are associated with reduced bone strength at the hip. Ct.Th and cortical sound velocity, i.e., a surrogate marker for changes of cortical porosity (Ct.Po), are key biomarkers for the identification of patients at high fracture risk. In this study, we have developed a method using a conventional ultrasound array transducer to determine thickness (Ct.Th) and the compressional sound velocity propagating in the radial bone direction (Ct.(nu 11)) using a refraction-corrected multifocus imaging approach. The method was validated in-silico on porous bone plate models using a 2-D finite-difference time-domain method and ex vivo on plate-shaped plastic reference materials and on plate-shaped cortical bovine tibia samples. Plane-wave pulse-echo measurements provided reference values to assess precision and accuracy of our method. In-silico results revealed the necessity to account for inclination-dependent transmission losses at the bone surface. Moreover, the dependence of Ct.(nu 11) on both porosity and pore density was observed. Ct.Th and Ct.(nu 11) obtained ex vivo showed a high correlation (R2>0.99) with reference values. The ex-vivo accuracy and precision for Ct.(nu 11) were 29.9 m/s and 0.94%, respectively, and those for Ct.Th were 0.04 mm and 1.09%, respectively. In conclusion, this numerical and experimental study demonstrates an accurate and precise estimation of Ct.Th and Ct.(nu 11). The developed multifocus technique may have high clinical potential to improve fracture risk prediction using noninvasive and nonionizing conventional ultrasound technology with image guidance.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1109/tuffc.2019.2948896","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Huong

Using laser-based ultrasonic techniques, we experimentally investigate some fascinating properties of these ZGV modes: resonance and ringing effects, backward wave propagation, interference between backward and forward modes. Then, the conditions required for the existence of ZGV Lamb modes in isotropic plates are discussed. It is shown that these modes appear in a range of Poisson's ratio about the value for which the cutoff frequency curves of modes belonging to the same family intercept, i.e., for a bulk wave velocity ratio equal to a rational number. An interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of a strong repulsion between a pair of modes having a different parity in the vicinity of the cutoff frequencies is given. Experiments performed with materials of various Poisson's ratio demonstrate that the resonance spectrum of an unloaded elastic plate, locally excited by a laser pulse, is dominated by the ZGV Lamb modes.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1121/1.2918543","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Claire","last_name":"Prada","affiliations":[],"email":"claire.prada-julia@espci.fr","orcid":"","h_index":13,"keywords":["adaptive","ribs","steering","invasive","ultrasonic","treatment","spherical","Beam","reversal","plate","resonance","using laser","edge","Lamb modes","zero group velocity","Ultrasonic array","Multi-mode imaging","Plane wave","Fourier-domain reconstruction","Time decay","continuum mechanics","first order","group velocity","ultrasonic testing","second order","nondestructive testing","acoustic waves","phase velocity","resonant frequency","poisson s ratio","titanium alloy","microstructures","titanium alloys","acoustic imaging","solids","time domain","lamb wave","microstructure","high resolution","matrix decomposition","eigenvectors","frequency","time reversal","underwater acoustics","structures","waves","negative refraction","resonant","lens","sup","Guided","optimization","acoustic","remote sensing","acoustic wave scattering","acoustic measurement","acoustic signal processing","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","multiple scattering","backscattered field","determining the elongation direction","shallow water","acoustic wave propagation","elasticity","genetic algorithms","plates (structures)","structural acoustics","ZGV","resonances","Gaussian","sources","annular","Lamb","beams","optimal geometric","threshold materials","plates","backward","elastic plate","frequencies","cutoff","laser","Poisson's","wave","acoustic wave production","acoustic wave interferometry","surface acoustic waves","solid lasers","vibrations","ultrasonic materials testing","heterodyne detection","acoustic wave interference"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":55,"location":null,"raw_text":"Prada, C.; Clorennec, D.; Royer, D.

This phenomenon is associated with the backward mode appearing in the range limited by the ZGV and cutoff frequencies. The modal frequency response of the structure, primarily the spectrum of the corresponding guided wave (GW) excited in the plate by a force source, is featured by a sharp peak at the ZGV frequency, allowing its experimental detection. Other peaks appearing at the cutoff frequencies indicate thickness resonances. In a layered half-space of infinite thickness, the backward-mode bend of the dispersion curve turns into a double bend that gives rise to three GWs associated with the same branch (one backward and two forward modes). Moreover, several adjacent branches with double bends, and, thus, several peaks, can appear in a narrow range as the number of layers increases, indicating multiple ZGV resonances. Such dispersion curves with double ZGV points were also found in waveguides of finite thickness with anisotropic or contrast material properties; however, their resonance manifestation is poorly studied. In this article, we consider and discuss several kinds of multi-peak ZGV responses using examples of layered samples of various materials. Along with the expected increase in the number of peaks in multilayer structures with contrast layers, it was noted that some ZGV points may or may not appear in peaks, depending on the type of load.
