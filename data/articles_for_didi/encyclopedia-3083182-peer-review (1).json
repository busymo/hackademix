Without the assistance of this modern armoury, great strides were made in describing the ways the eyes move. For Aristotle the fundamental features of eye movements were binocular, and he described the combined functions of the eyes. This was later given support using simple procedures like placing a finger over the eyelid of the closed eye and culminated in Hering's law of equal innervation. However, the overriding concern in the 19th century was with eye position rather than eye movements. Appreciating discontinuities of eye movements arose from studies of vertigo. The characteristics of nystagmus were recorded before those of saccades and fixations. Eye movements during reading were described by Hering and by Lamare in 1879; both used similar techniques of listening to sounds made during contractions of the extraocular muscles. Photographic records of eye movements during reading were made by Dodge early in the 20th century, and this stimulated research using a wider array of patterns. In the mid-20th century attention shifted to the stability of the eyes during fixation, with the emphasis on involuntary movements. The contributions of pioneers from Aristotle to Yarbus are outlined.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1068/i0389","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nicholas

First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1038/35058500","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Laurent","last_name":"Itti","affiliations":[],"email":"itti@usc.edu","orcid":"","h_index":23,"keywords":["Information","Surprise","Relative

On this view, focal-attention is guided by an overall-saliency map of the scene, which integrates (sums) signals from pre-attentive sensory feature-contrast computations (e.g., for color, motion, etc.). By linking the Posterior Contralateral Negativity (PCN) component to reaction time (RT) performance, we tested one specific prediction of such salience summation models: expedited shifts of focal-attention to targets with low, as compared to high, target-distracter similarity. For two feature-dimensions (color and orientation), we observed decreasing RTs with increasing target saliency. Importantly, this pattern was systematically mirrored by the timing, as well as amplitude, of the PCN. This pattern demonstrates that visual saliency is a key determinant of the time it takes for focal-attention to be engaged onto the target item, even when it is just a feature singleton.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0016276","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Thomas","last_name":"Töllner","affiliations":[],"email":"thomas.toellner@psy.lmu.de","orcid":"","h_index":12,"keywords":["Vision","Reaction time","Event-related potentials","Attention","Coding mechanisms","Electroencephalography","Electrode potentials","Functional magnetic resonance imaging","task switching","task sets","attentional selection","perceptual processing","executive control","Central Bottleneck","Decision Making","LRP","PCN","attentional capture","N2pc","Saliency","visual search","stimulus–response translation","visual attention","perceptual decision making","distractor templates","visual selective attention","illusory figures","memory","items","WM representations","dimension","neural","structured","contralateral delay","Dimensional weighting","Enumeration","Distraction","ERP-component latency","Event-related potentials (ERPs)","Posterior contralateral negativity (PCN)","cognitive control","conflict processing","independent component analysis","color","luminance","memory search","nontarget interference","hierarchical level","figure","Kanizsa","attentional","defined","detection","behavioral","adults","perceptual","related potentials","event related","changes","specific","effects","age","eeg","n1","tms","adhd","decision-making","neuro-cognitive endophenotypes","psychophysics","stimulus-response translation","pop-out search","saliency-based mechanisms","Aging","Compensation","Contralateral delay activity (CDA)","Event-related potentials (ERP)","Individual differences","Processing speed","Theory of visual attention","Visual-short term memory (vSTM)","working memory","ERP","attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","electrophysiology","performance level","visual","Adhd Patients","control processes","Adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder","Visual short-term memory","EEG event-related potentials","Contralateral Delay Activity","P3b","visual working memory","amodal completion","functional","stimuli","task","TVA","event","related lateralizations","Lateralizations Mark","related electroencephalographic","Electroencephalographic Lateralizations","maintenance","CDA","lateralization for verbal versus spatial","Cognitive Aging","Global-local Processing","Kanizsa figures","Inhibition deficit","N2-posterior contralateral (N2pc)","body posture","exercise","mobile brain imaging"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":17,"location":null,"raw_text":"Tollner, T.; Zehetleitner, M.; Gramann, K.; Muller, H.J.

This pathway purportedly runs from the superior colliculus to the amygdala via the pulvinar, and thus presents a methodological challenge to study noninvasively in the human brain. Here, we present our recent work where we reliably reconstructed the white matter structure and directional flow of neural signal along this pathway in over 600 healthy young adults. Critically, we found structure-function relationships for the pulvinar-amygdala connection, where people with greater fibre density had stronger functional neural coupling and were also better at recognising fearful facial expressions. These results tie together recent anatomical evidence from other visual primates with very recent optogenetic research on rodents demonstrating a functional role of this pathway in producing fear responses. Here, we discuss how this pathway might operate alongside other thalamo-cortical circuits (such as pulvinar to middle temporal area) and how its structure and function may change according to the sensory input it receives. This newly established circuit might play a potentially important role in autism and/or anxiety disorders.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1177/1179069519846445","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jessica","last_name":"McFadyen","affiliations":[],"email":"j.mcfadyen@uq.edu.au","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["neural","pathway","fear","afferent","subcortical","functionally","Modelled","pulvinar amygdala","CFS","BCFs","faces","Consciousness","Perception","perceptual decision making","Awareness","Flash suppression","Emotional expressions","facial expressions","neutral faces","fearful faces","EEG","Electroencephalography","CPP","P300","mismatch","breakthrough","Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS)","reward","replay","Differential","punishment paths predicts","paths predicted","prior","Decision","Biomedicine","general","Neurosciences","Behavioral Sciences","Biological Techniques","Neurobiology","Animal Genetics and Genomics","observed actions","made","N1 suppression","tones caused","implicit","sensory","Vision","Sensory perception","Face","Social discrimination","Attention","Emotions","Face recognition","Questionnaires","audiovisual","fMRI","human","multisensory","associated with specific motor responses","specific predictions","identity specific","made actions","implicit measures","Doorway effect","Memory","Spatial navigation","Event boundary","Observed pain","Racial bias","Minimal group","Other-race contact","spatial frequency","route","discriminated","emotional","Frequency or Emotion","gender","neural network","Amygdala Connection","amygdala","dynamic causal modeling","emotion","pulvinar","superior colliculus","connectivity","survival","modelling","accumulation","Evidence","threats","stimuli","neutral","accelerate","Fearful","diffusion","functional","decision making","adaptive","brain","cognitive","shortcuts","processing","lower order","MEG","decoding","machine learning","representations","neuroimaging"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":19,"location":null,"raw_text":"McFadyen, J.

Compared with three other categories of stimuli (monkey faces, monkey hands, and geometrical shapes), snakes elicited the strongest, fastest responses, and the responses were not reduced by low spatial filtering. These findings integrate neuroscience with evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, herpetology, and primatology by identifying a neurobiological basis for primates' heightened visual

Our research has shown that the poured patterns of the American abstract painter Jackson Pollock are also fractal. This discovery raises an intriguing possibility  are the visual characteristics of fractals responsible for the long-term appeal of Pollocks work? To address this question, we have conducted ten years of scientific investigation of human response to fractals and here we present, for the first time, a review of this research that examines the inter-relationship between the various results. The investigations include eye-tracking, visual preference, skin conductance, and EEG measurement techniques. We discuss the artistic implications of the positive perceptual and physiological responses to fractal

The ability to represent recursive structures has been hypothesized to increase the efficiency of hierarchical processing. Theoretical work together with recent empirical findings suggests that the ability to represent the self-similar structure of hierarchical recursive stimuli may be supported by internal neural representations that compress raw external information and increase efficiency. In order to explicitly test whether the representation of recursive hierarchies depends on internalized rules we compared the processing of visual hierarchies represented either as recursive or non-recursive, using task-free resting-state fMRI data. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between task-evoked functional networks induced \"by cognitive representations with the corresponding resting-state architecture. We observed increased connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) related brain areas during the representation of recursion, while non-recursive representations yielded increased connectivity within the Fronto-Parietal Control-Network. Our results suggest that human hierarchical information processing using recursion is supported by the DMN. In particular, the representation of recursion seems to constitute an internally-biased mode of information-processing that is mediated by both the core and dorsal-medial subsystems of the DMN. Compressed internal rule representations mediated by the DMN may help humans to represent and process hierarchical structures in complex environments by considerably reducing information processing load.

In this study we addressed hierarchy in the visual domain, using a novel paradigm based on fractal images. Fractals are self-similar patterns generated by repeating the same simple rule at multiple hierarchical levels. Our hypothesis was that the brain uses different resources for processing hierarchies depending on whether it applies a fractal or a non-fractal cognitive strategy. We analyzed the neural circuits activated by these complex hierarchical patterns in an event-related fMRI study of 40 healthy subjects. Brain activation was compared across three different tasks: a similarity task, and two hierarchical tasks in which subjects were asked to recognize the repetition of a rule operating transformations either within an existing hierarchical level, or generating new hierarchical levels. Similar hierarchical images were generated by both rules and target images were identical. We found that when processing visual hierarchies, engagement in both hierarchical tasks activated the visual dorsal stream (occipito-parietal cortex, intraparietal sulcus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). In addition, the level-generating task specifically activated circuits related to the integration of spatial and categorical information, and with the integration of items in contexts (posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and medial, ventral and anterior regions of temporal cortex). These findings provide interesting new clues about the cognitive mechanisms involved in the generation of new hierarchical levels as required for fractals.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.064","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Isabel

Architectural beauty needs to be evaluated from its effects on human health. This study discusses two diagnostic tools for measuring the degree of architectural beauty and presents the results of the pilot application of one of them. The goal is to use diagnostic imaging for evaluations. Analytical elements are introduced from disciplines with which practitioners are normally not familiar, such as artificial intelligence, medicine, neuroscience, visual attention and image-processing software, etc. In addition to the diagnostic tools, this paper ties related ideas on objective beauty into a novel synthesis. These results support the idea of a feasible, objective way to evaluate what the users will consider as beautiful, and set the stage for an upcoming larger study that will quantitatively correlate the two methods.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/challe13020056","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Alexandros

The recent advent of affordable wearable sensors has considerably expanded the range of these possibilities to fields such as computer gaming, education, entertainment, health, neuromarketing, psychology, etc. The Visual Attention Software by 3M (3M-VAS) is an artificial intelligence application that was formulated using experimental data from eye-tracking. It can be used to predict viewer reactions to images, generating fixation point probability maps and fixation point sequence estimations, thus revealing pre-attentive processing of visual stimuli with a very high degree of accuracy. We have used 3M-VAS software in an innovative implementation to analyze images of different buildings, either in their original state or photographically manipulated, as well as various geometric patterns. The software not only reveals non-obvious fixation points, but also overall relative design coherence, a key element of Christopher Alexanders theory of geometrical order. A more evenly distributed field of attention seen in some structures contrasts with other buildings being ignored, those showing instead unconnected points of splintered attention. Our findings are non-intuitive and surprising. We link these results to both Alexanders theory and Neuroscience, identify potential pitfalls in the softwares use, and also suggest ways to avoid them.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/app11136197","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Alexandros

The recent introduction of affordable wearable sensors has significantly broadened the scope of potential uses, spanning fields such as computer gaming, education, entertainment, health, neuromarketing, and psychology, among others. Another development is the use of downloadable software, which permits participants to record their responses to presented images with the use of calibrated webcams without leaving their homes, allowing for easier recruitment of larger numbers of study volunteers online. This paper reviews findings from seven Building Studies conducted by the Human Architecture + Planning Institute with iMotions-Online eye-tracking software, highlighting the significance of the new technology and its ability to assess the human experience of the built environment, as well as its limitations. Overall, images with a certain type of organized complexity, such as that found in nature and pre-modern architecture, attracted the gaze faster and kept it for significantly longer, as compared to images lacking these features. These results add to our existing knowledge about environmental complexity and give us insights into non-conscious and early conscious actions such as first gaze attraction, helping us understand the

The purpose of the present study was to explore the psychophysiological signature of the subjective experience of boredom. Healthy undergraduates (n = 72) viewed previously validated and standardized video clips to induce boredom, sadness, and a neutral affective state, while their heart rate (HR), skin conductance levels (SCL), and cortisol levels were measured. Boredom yielded dynamic psychophysiological responses that differed from the other emotional states. Of particular interest, the physiological signature of boredom relative to sadness was characterized by rising HR, decreased SCL, and increased cortisol levels. This pattern of results suggests that boredom may be associated with both increased arousal and difficulties with sustained attention. These findings may help to resolve divergent conceptualizations of boredom in the extant literature and, ultimately, to enhance our understanding and treatment of clinical syndromes in which self-reported boredom is a prominent symptom.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s00221-013-3755-2","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Danckert","affiliations":[],"email":"jdancker@uwaterloo.ca","orcid":"","h_index":19,"keywords":["Neglect","Spatial and saccadic remapping","Spatial working memory","Attention","batteries","Concussion","athletes","speed","Computerized","Deficits","Cogsport","measure of motor control","right hemisphere","Perception of Multisecond","underestimate","Intervals","durations","unilateral neglect","Temporal estimation","Parietal cortex","Nonspatial deficits","Spatial attention","Superior parietal cortex","Tactile search","Optic ATAXIA","Peripersonal space","Functional","seizure","MRI","tissue","cortical","MCD","malformations","EEG","dysplastic","cortex","insula cortex","putamen","representational updating","superior temporal gyrus","Spatial cognition","Line bisection","Eye movements","Mental Model","Attentional Blink","Motor Imagery","Boredom","Depression","Heart rate","Skin conductance levels","adaptation","rehabilitate","Prisms on Perception","Differential Effects","Effects of Prisms","Observed on Actions","perception and action","Rightward","Temporal perception","Prediction","Mental models","Updating","survive","neural","representations","cortical network","anterior","insula","inferior","perceptual","Self-control","Traumatic brain injury","Aggression","Sustained attention","Default mode network","Anterior insula","Boredom Proneness Scale","exploratory factor analysis","confirmatory factor analysis","item response theory","ADHD","TBI","Dynamic","Precuneus","Cuneus","fMRI","mind-wandering","Understanding Engagement","Danckert","Central Executive Network","Boredom Proneness","Boredom Signals","Arousal","Restlessness","Right brain damage","Mental representations","Updating failures","Picture morphing","Exploration","Perceptual decision making","Uncertainty","Proactive vs. reactive","Self-regulation","Motivation","foraging gene","locomotion","assessment","PRKG1","Representational drawing","Figure copying","Visuoconstructional skills","VLSM","Opportunity costs","Perceived control","challenge","engagement","Frustration","Saccadic latency","Dwell time","Belief updating","Probabilistic learning","Surprise","Posterior parietal cortex","Reaching","Motor control","Prism adaptation","Parietal lobe","cerebellum","functional MRI","human","visuomotor control","self-esteem","academic performance","GPA","Blindsight","Occipital cortex","Extrastriate","Residual vision","Action-blindsight","Dorsal stream","Kinematics","COVID-19","Political ideology","Rule-breaking","creativity","COVID-19 pandemic","well-being","pandemic","cognitive engagement","novelty","damage","lesions","Temporal","task","cerebellar","Covert","reflexive","blink","Disrupt","eating","OFC","adolescence","diet"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":37,"location":null,"raw_text":"Merrifield, C.; Danckert, J.

Certain visual stimuli, however, cause visual stress, a set of adverse effects ranging from simple discomfort to migraine attacks, and epileptic seizures in the extreme, all phenomena linked with an excessive metabolic demand. The theory of efficient coding suggests a link between excessive metabolic demand and images that deviate from natural statistics. Yet, the mechanisms linking energy demand and image spatial content in discomfort remain elusive. Here, we used theories of visual coding that link image spatial structure and brain activation to characterize the response to images observers reported as uncomfortable in a biologically based neurodynamic model of the early visual cortex that included excitatory and inhibitory layers to implement contextual influences. We found three clear markers of aversive images: a larger overall activation in the model, a less sparse response, and a more unbalanced distribution of activity across spatial orientations. When the ratio of excitation over inhibition was increased in the model, a phenomenon hypothesised to underlie interindividual differences in susceptibility to visual discomfort, the three markers of discomfort progressively shifted towards values typical of the response to uncomfortable stimuli. Overall, these findings propose a unifying mechanistic explanation for why there are differences between images and between observers, suggesting how visual input and idiosyncratic hyperexcitability give rise to abnormal brain responses that result in visual stress.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3389/fnins.2023.1200661","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Olivier","last_name":"Penacchio","affiliations":[],"email":"op5@st-andrews.ac.uk","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["optimally","countershading","camouflage","adaptation","body orientation","respect","animals","crypsis","detect","design","fourier spectrum","natural images","scale invariance","visual discomfort","IPS","intermittent photic stimulation","PPR","photoparoxysmal response","reflex seizures","Pattern-sensitive epilepsy","Self-induction","Visual stimuli","Uncomfortable images","font","spatial periodicity","discomfort","reading speed","autocorrelation","Fourier amplitude spectrum","shape-from-shading","foraging","visual camouflage","search efficiency","visual search","evolution","neuroscience","ecology","Architectural façades","curvature","aesthetics","visual comfort","image analysis","antipredator","orientation","predation","visual ecology","polymorphism","aposematism","multifarious selection","visual signal","poison frog","complex picture","defining features","hedonic evaluations","manipulations","contour and shape","preference","migraine","vision","colour","colour perception","chromatic induction","psychophysics","predator","natural selection","shape from shading","Deceive","coloration","animal","animal pattern","avian vision","computational neuroscience","defensive coloration","image statistics","Lepidoptera"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":38,"location":null,"raw_text":"Penacchio, O.; Otazu, X.; Wilkins, A.J.; Haigh, S.M.

The present review examines this model in terms of whether different types of emotion-evocative stimuli are associated with discrete and invariant patterns of responding in each response system, how such responses are structured, and if such responses converge across different response systems. Across response systems, the bulk of the available evidence favours the idea that measures of emotional responding reflect dimensions rather than discrete states. In addition, experiential, physiological, and behavioural response systems are associated with unique sources of variance, which in turn limits the magnitude of convergence across measures. Accordingly, the authors suggest that there is no gold standard measure of emotional responding. Rather, experiential, physiological, and behavioural measures are all relevant to understanding emotion and cannot be assumed to be interchangeable.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1080/02699930802204677","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Iris B.","last_name":"Mauss","affiliations":[],"email":"imauss@psy.du.edu","orcid":"","h_index":10,"keywords":["Emotion","Cultural differences","Values","Cardiovascular threat versus challenge","lonely","striving","functional","feel","loneliness","wanting","valuing happiness","personal","people","control group","positive emotion","social-functional","experience- behavior dissociation","psychological functioning","social connectedness","Measurement","Self-report","Autonomic nervous system","Startle modulation","Central nervous system","Behaviour","Specificity","Emotional responding","Asian-American and European-American cultural background","Mediation","Cultural values","Anger experience","Anger expression","Autonomic physiology","Emotion regulation","Control","Anger","Experience","Priming","Physiology","Automatic emotion regulation","Implicit Evaluation","IAT","Physiological Responding","Cognitive reappraisal","empirical evidence","beliefs","efficacy","expectancies","acceptance","negative emotion","stressors","psychological health","culture and automatic emotion regulation","automatic processes in emotion regulation (AER)","emotions and emotion regulation","response-focused versus antecedent-focused emotion regulation","deliberate versus automatic emotion regulation","socio-cultural contexts and automatic emotion regulation","response-focused automatic emotion regulation","antecedent-focused automatic emotion regulation","negative affect","SCL","statistically mediated","acceptance statistically","measurement modalities","discrete negative","increased acceptance","lower anger","negative emotions","time points"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":39,"location":null,"raw_text":"Mauss, I.B.; Robinson, M.D. Measures of emotion: A review.

Background: Vision is an important human sense through which people acquire a large amount of environmental information. ETDs are tools for detecting eye/gaze behaviors, facilitating better understanding about how people collect visual information and how such information is related to emotions and psychological states. However, there is a lack of guidance for the application of ETDs to environment and behavior studies. Methods: A literature review was conducted on articles reporting empirical studies that used ETDs. The data were extracted and compiled, including information such as research questions, research design, types of ETDs, variables measured, types of physical environment (or visual stimuli), stimuli durations, data analysis methods, and so on. Results: Fifty articles were identified. The main research topics were related to urban and landscape environments, and architecture and interior spaces. Most of the research designs were experimental or quasi-experimental designs, with a few cross-sectional studies. The majority types of ETDs were screen-based ETDs, followed by mobile ETDs (glasses).

A subjective experience with a building is the specific manner in which an architectural element or the building as a whole are presented to a person. The qualities of the element as how they are perceived and the inner world of the observer are both considered in this subjective experience. The aims of this study are to describe the experience that a building generates in people, pinpoint what has attracted the participant's attention during each view of the building in an itinerary; and understand which aspects of this selected case study have made it an object of attention. An eye-tracking study was carried out using a portable eye tracker. This tool allowed the participants to walk freely around the exterior of a historic train station in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. Two groups of participants, with routes starting from opposite sides of the building, contemplated it while using the eye tracker. Eye tracking allowed for the identification of the architectural elements that were objects of attention, the lengths of observation, and the points of view from which the elements were observed. Other data collection techniques, such as the think-aloud protocol and a special type of survey, were used to deeply understand the experiences that accompanied the visual exploration of the historic building. Results suggest that the participants observed the different architectural elements for a time that was neither influenced by the route used to explore the building nor the point where that route was initiated. The architectural elements identified as examples of high-quality architecture and perceived as aesthetically pleasing by the participants during the itinerary were observed for longer times.

Human experience in an architectural space is defined as the state of mind that is reflected on our physiological, emotional, and cognitive statuses. Previous studies attempted to explain the relation between architectural design features (e.g., the existence of daylight and connectivity to nature) and human experience. However, the extent of how different design features influence human experience has not been fully quantified yet. This study provides an integrated method that fuses virtual reality and noninvasive body area sensor networks (BSNs) to quantify human experience in architectural spaces. Using a set of biometric sensors, several physiological metrics such as skin conductance, brain activity, and heart rate were captured and examined while subjects were navigating and performing tasks in virtual environments (VEs). The integrated platform has been used to quantify the sense of stress and anxiety through structured user experiments in a visualization laboratory using alternate VEs configured by varying the related set of architectural design features. To generalize the findings of this study, a large pool of participants was invited to the experiments, where statistically significantly different results could be obtained. The analysis of the collected body sensor data showed that the human response changes with architectural design, with more than 40% of the electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations having higher values across all channels on all frequency bands, 141% having an increase in galvanic skin response (GSR) readings, and lower heart rate variability in photoplethysmogram (PPG) in the stress-reducing environment as compared with the stress-inducing environment. The presented approach provides a systematic way for architectural design firms to get user feedback before the design is finalized for achieving the ultimate experience among the proposed design alternatives.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1061/(asce)cp.1943-5487.0000812","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Zhengbo","last_name":"Zou","affiliations":[],"email":"zhengbo@civil.ubc.ca","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["Architectural design","Feature attribution","Data-driven methods","Human experience","Virtual environments","Training","Construction robots","Imitation learning","Construction robot","Reinforcement learning","Virtual environment","BIM","virtual reality","facility management","Body sensor networks","Biometric sensors","Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Architecture design","Neuroscience","Urban form","Electroencephalogram","Robotics","HVAC inspection","Leakage detection","Thermography","SLAM","Deep learning","Computer vision","Airport asphalt pavement","Association rule mining","Apriori algorithm","Preventive maintenance","Pavement distress","Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC)","3D point cloud semantic segmentation","LiDAR","Airport pavement","Binary classification problem","Confusion matrix","ROC curve","K-S curve","visual-language model","Energy auditing","Generative adversarial imitation learning","Quality assurance","Building components","Semantic segmentation","Synthetic images","Dexterous manipulation","Robotic hand","Anthropomorphic"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":62,"location":null,"raw_text":"Ergan, S.; Radwan, A.; Zou, Z.; Tseng, H.-a.; Han, X.

Standardization and comparability have received some attention; for instance, there exist a number of commonly used facial expression databases. However, lack of a commonly accepted evaluation protocol and, typically, lack of sufficient details needed to reproduce the reported individual results make it difficult to compare systems. This, in turn, hinders the progress of the field. A periodical challenge in facial expression recognition would allow such a comparison on a level playing field. It would provide an insight on how far the field has come and would allow researchers to identify new goals, challenges, and targets. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the first such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, held during the IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition 2011. It details the challenge data, evaluation protocol, and the results attained in two subchallenges: AU detection and classification of facial expression imagery in terms of a number of discrete emotion categories. We also summarize the lessons learned and reflect on the future of the field of facial expression recognition in general and on possible future challenges in

However, it has been difficult to construe a common understanding of aesthetic experience for architectural space, since different studies use different scales to measure aesthetic experiences. In this interdisciplinary study spanning cognitive science and architecture, we aim to provide an empirically driven systematic characterization of human aesthetic experience and investigate what aspects of the architectural spaces affect aesthetic experience. To this end, we manipulated various architectural variables including the shape of the curvilinear boundaries of architectural spaces as well as their size, light, texture, and color in virtual reality. We then had people evaluate these spaces by exhausting a large list of commonly used scales in the literature and applied principal component analysis to reveal the key dimensions of aesthetic experience. Our findings suggest that human aesthetic experience can be reduced to 3 key dimensions, namely familiarity, excitement, and fascination. Each of these dimensions are differentially affected by the various architectural variables revealing their differences. In sum, our study provides a comprehensive framework to characterize human aesthetic experience in virtual architectural spaces with curved boundaries.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1037/aca0000504","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tuğçe Elver","last_name":"Boz","affiliations":[],"email":"tugce.elver@bilkent.edu.tr","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Gender attribution","Social-robots","Gender stereotype","Actions","Human–robot interaction","aesthetic experience","spatial cognition","emotion","environmental psychology","virtual reality"]},{"first_name":"Halime","last_name":"Demirkan","affiliations":[],"email":"demirkan@bilkent.edu.tr","orcid":"","h_index":13,"keywords":["Academic performance","design education","gender","learning style","Computer-assisted design tool","Conceptual design phase","Cognitive design strategy","Universal design","Ontology","Multi-agent systems","Designer","Information environment","variance","creativity","Dimension","holistic","Design Process","items","Hidden","Strongest","composed","corresponded","Experiential learning","Learning styles","built environment","adaptable","functional","obvious","Later","recognised","houses were designed","aging","Model","critiques","segmentation","collaborative","space","solution","design strategies","problem domain","design for all","physically disabled","elderly","visual impairment","Virtual environment","Vertical navigation","Architectural cue","Staircase","Geometric attribute","Individual difference","child","elements of creativity","sixth","structure","grade","art","room","person","Architectural design","Activities of daily living","Aging in place","Collaboration","Elderly resident","design","nature","principal component","interior environment","prioritization","morphological analysis","sustainability","web based","framework","course","design studio","Considering","based education","indoor environmental quality","lighting quality","occupant satisfaction and performance","sound quality","thermal quality","digital educational technologies","flow state","motivation","spatial ability","virtual reality","Psychological distress","Anxiety","Boredom","Confined environments","COVID-19","Lockdown","Interior design","Isolated environments","aesthetic experience","spatial cognition","emotion","environmental psychology","design knowledge","information processing","safety","architecture","Cognitive","reflections","Interior","diverse","structured","Role Playing","empathic"]},{"first_name":"Burcu A.","last_name":"Urgen","affiliations":[],"email":"burcu.urgen@bilkent.edu.tr","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["biological motion","neural","biological form","perception","motion kinematics","functions","Robot","Android","differential","EEG","action perception","social robotics","mirror neuron system","mu rhythm","Theta Rhythm","parietal","univariate analysis","communicative actions","control stimuli","human specific","different action","indirect communication","cortex of different","Prediction","Expectation violation","Human–robot interaction","Audio–visual mismatch","decision making","models","motion","LRP signal","theoretical framework","human participants","vision","action observation","fMRI","action videos","naturalistic stimuli","cognitive neuroscience","systems neuroscience","Gender attribution","Social-robots","Gender stereotype","Actions","Dynamical causal modeling","Predictive coding","Electromyography","Imitative Processing","body movements","human robot interaction","social cognition","Computational modeling","Visualization","Brain modeling","Semantics","Humanoid robots","Trajectory","inferior","brain","DCM","ventral","functional","AON","cortex","amplified effect","adults","multimodal stimuli","elicit","uncanny","visual components","valley effect","affect how we perceive","incongruent","human agents","visual","voice","cue","expectations affect","aesthetic experience","spatial cognition","emotion","environmental psychology","virtual reality","occipito temporal","processing of BM","attentional load","survival","perceptual load","cortically","magnified","task irrelevant biological","irrelevant biological motion","Uncanny valley","Predictive processing","N400","Social neuroscience","Computer vision","Representational similarity analysis","Modeling","PSTS","Inferior parietal cortex","Ventral premotor cortex","Personality traits","LSTM","FastText","Preprocessing","Personality dataset","Neuroscience","Issue 198","scientific video journal","MVPA","görsel algı","biyolojik hareket algısı","dikkat","dikkat yükü","nörogörüntüleme","warp semantic","Warping of Semantic Representations","shifts","Task"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":73,"location":null,"raw_text":"Elver Boz, T.; Demirkan, H.; Urgen, B.

In this study, we tested two hypotheses about the relationship between people and built environments. First, aesthetic responses to architectural interiors reduce to a few key psychological dimensions that are sensitive to design features. Second, these psychological dimensions evoke specific neural signatures. In Experiment 1, participants (n = 798) rated 200 images of architectural interiors on 16 aesthetic response measures. Using Psychometric Network Analysis (PNA) and Principal Components Analysis (PCA), we identified three components that explained 90% of the variance in ratings: coherence (ease with which one organizes and comprehends a scene), fascination (a scenes informational richness and generated interest), and hominess (extent to which a scene reflects a personal space). Whereas coherence and fascination are well-established dimensions in response to natural scenes and visual art, hominess emerged as a new dimension related to architectural interiors. In Experiment 2 (n = 614), the PCA results were replicated in an independent sample, indicating the robustness of these three dimensions. In Experiment 3, we reanalyzed data from an fMRI study in which participants (n = 18) made beauty judgments and approach-avoidance decisions when viewing the same images. Parametric analyses demonstrated that, regardless of task, the degree of fascination covaried with neural activity in the right lingual gyrus. In contrast, coherence covaried with neural activity in the left inferior occipital gyrus only when participants judged beauty, whereas hominess covaried with neural activity in the left cuneus only when they made approach-avoidance decisions. Importantly, this neural activation did not covary in relation to global image properties including self-similarity and complexity scores. These results suggest that the visual brain harbors sensitivities to psychological dimensions of coherence, fascination, and hominess in the context of architectural interiors. Furthermore, valuation of architectural processing in visual cortices varies by dimension and

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze emotions and task performance in terms of dislike and personalized decision-making in indoor spaces. To facilitate experiments with participants, a mixed-reality environment was utilized with the Pleasure, Arousal, Dominance (PAD) test and cognitive tests. The results of the experiment conducted on 30 subjects identified that aroused and discontented emotions dominated in non-preferred spaces, but pleased, important, and autonomous emotions arose in personalized spaces, as determined through sentimental analysis and statistical methods. Although negative emotions were present in the aversion space, attention and execution abilities were high compared to the personalized space, but working memory was low. By conducting stepwise regression analysis, it was found that working in a visually unfavorable space, which caused an increase in controlled or controlling emotions, improved short-term work efficiency. In addition, important emotions did not have a positive effect on any task performance. However, with pleased and contented emotions in a personalized indoor space, long-term work efficiency was increased, as explained by the Yerkes-Dodson

Although no consensus has yet been reached on the reasons for this preference, similar effects have been proposed in interior environments. However, the scarcely available research primarily depends on schematic or unmatched stimuli and faces heterogeneity in the reported results. In a within-subject design, we investigated the curvature positive effect in photo-realistic indoor environments using stimulus material previously tested in virtual-reality (VR). 198 online participants rated 20 living room images, exclusively manipulated on the contour (angular vs. curved) and style (modern vs. classic) levels. The rating scales represented aesthetic (i.e., beauty, liking) and stress response (i.e., rest, stress). Beyond our main focus on contour, we additionally examined style and sex effects to account for potential interactions. Results revealed a significant main effect of contour on both aesthetic (η2g = 1-2%) and stress (η2g = 8-12%) response evaluations. As expected, images of curved contours scored higher than their angular counterparts on beauty, liking, and rest scales, and lower on the stress scale. In terms of interactions with style, curvature was aesthetically preferred over angularity only within images depicting modern style, however, its positive effect on stress response remained significant irrespective of style. Furthermore, we observed sex differences in aesthetic but not in stress responses, with curvature preference only found in women in our sample. In sum, our study primarily confirms positive effects of curvature, however, with multiple layers. First, the impact on aesthetic preference seems to be influenced by individual and contextual factors. Second, in terms of stress response, which might be especially relevant for designs intended to promote mental-health, the consistent effects suggest a more generalizable, potentially biophilic characteristic of curves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate these effects in fully-matched, photo-realistic, and multi-perspective living environment images. From the background of the previous VR trial whereby the same rooms did not elicit differences, our findings propose that static images vs. immersed presentations might yield different results in the response to contour.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2022.933344","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nour","last_name":"Tawil","affiliations":[],"email":"tawil@mpib-berlin.mpg.de","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["interior design 1","contours 2","style 3","aesthetic preference 4","Stress Response 5","sex-related differences 5 .

However, the direct relation of specific forms with specific affective states is difficult to determine. In addition, no systematic categorization of architectural forms and their relation to emotional states exists. The investigation of the impact of architectural features on inhabitants' emotions is further complicated by the use of two-dimensional images of forms in laboratory investigations, which cannot perceive real-world architecture. Furthermore, the interior form consists of a combination of different forms rather than only pure forms, which was considered in previous studies. This study aimed to fill these gaps by evaluating interior forms on the basis of clustering different images of built living rooms throughout history as well as their impact on emotions. This study used pleasure, arousal, and dominance ratings with an emphasis on individual differences in personality. Virtual sample rooms were created based on formal clusters of architectural forms. Results showed a relationship between forms and emotional states for different personality traits. This work provided a novel approach on the influence of architecture on emotion by considering systematic form categorization and combinations, personality differences, and a virtual reality

The question that this study attempts to start addressing is therefore whether certain design, characteristics of indoor spaces can make a difference to the physiological stress response as well. Using a virtual version of the Trier Social Stress Test, in which the space is computer generated and properties of the space therefore can be systematically varied, we measured saliva cortisol and heart rate variability in participants in a closed room versus a room with openings. As shown by a significant linear contrast interaction between groups and TSST conditions, participants in the closed room responded with more pronounced cortisol reactivity to stress induction, and continued to show higher levels throughout recovery, compared to participants in the open room.

This can be achieved through the understanding of neurophysiological correlates of architectural perception. To this aim, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of 12 healthy subjects were recorded during the perception of three immersive virtual reality environments (VEs). Afterwards, participants were asked to describe their experience in terms of Familiarity, Novelty, Comfort, Pleasantness, Arousal, and Presence using a rating scale from 1 to 9. These perceptual dimensions are hypothesized to influence the pattern of cerebral spectral activity, while Presence is used to assess the realism of the virtual stimulation. Hence, the collected scores were used to analyze the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the EEG for each behavioral dimension in the theta, alpha and mu bands by means of time-frequency analysis and topographic statistical maps. Analysis of Presence resulted in the activation of the frontal-midline theta, indicating the involvement of sensorimotor integration mechanisms when subjects expressed to feel more present in the VEs. Similar patterns also characterized the experience of familiar and comfortable VEs. In addition, pleasant VEs increased the theta power across visuomotor circuits and activated the alpha band in areas devoted to visuospatial exploration and processing of categorical spatial relations. Finally, the de-synchronization of the mu rhythm described the perception of pleasant and comfortable VEs, showing the involvement of left motor areas and embodied mechanisms for environment appreciation. Overall, these results show the possibility to measure EEG correlates of architectural perception involving the cerebral circuits of sensorimotor integration, spatial navigation, and embodiment. These observations can help testing architectural hypotheses in order to design environments matching the changing needs of humans.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01944","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Giovanni","last_name":"Vecchiato","affiliations":[],"email":"giovanni.vecchiato@uniroma1.it","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["High-resolution

The present work analyses the effect that these sources have on the stress reduction of patients companions in a paediatric service. A two-phase study was carried out. During the first phase, 120 participants assessed 20 waiting rooms in situ in order to select the environmental sources with the greatest effect. During the second phase, the stress levels of 26 participants were measured in four simulated waiting rooms that combined the selected sources from the first phase. A multisensory simulation was carried out through a virtual reality experiment with visual, auditory and olfactory elements, and stress levels were measured at the psychological and neurophysiological levels.

In this health research, exposure to virtual architecture has been used as a proxy for exposure to physical architecture. Despite the growing body of research on the health implications of physical architecture, there is a paucity of research examining the long-term health impacts of prolonged exposure to virtual architecture. In response, this paper considers: what can proxy studies, which use virtual architecture to assess the physiological response to physical architecture, tell us about the impact of extended exposure to virtual architecture on human health? The paper goes on to suggest that the applicability of these findings to virtual architecture may be limited by certain confounding variables when virtual architecture is experienced for a prolonged period of time. This paper explores the potential impact of two of these confounding variables: multisensory integration and gravitational perception. This paper advises that these confounding variables are unique to extended virtual architecture exposure and may not be captured by proxy studies that aim to capture the impact of physical architecture on human health through acute exposure to virtual architecture. While proxy studies may be suitable for measuring some aspects of the impact of both physical and virtual architecture on human health, this paper argues that they may be insufficient to fully capture the unintended consequences of extended exposure to virtual architecture on human health. Therefore, in the face of the increasing use of virtual architectural environments, the author calls for the establishment of a subfield of neuroarchitectural health research that empirically examines the physiological impacts of extended exposure to virtual architecture in its own right.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph20032735","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Cleo","last_name":"Valentine","affiliations":[],"email":"crv29@cam.ac.uk","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["architectural health","allostatic overloading","neuroimmunology","architectural neuroimmunology","urban health","virtual reality","virtual architecture","neuroarchitecture","environmental health"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":83,"location":null,"raw_text":"Valentine, C.

To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review to assess peerreviewed experimental studies, proofofconcept studies, and conference proceedings that examined the use of FIVEs in the context of interior design research, and 22 studies met our inclusion criteria. Current challenges include lack of perceived realism and immersion, lack of sensory feedback, and time constraints. Key considerations for the effective use of FIVEs include technological considerations, experimental design, measurement techniques, and evaluation methods. Key future research directions include enhancing the realism and immersiveness of FIVEs and promoting multiuser studies.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1111/joid.12171","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jun Rong Jeffrey","last_name":"Neo","affiliations":[],"email":"jn458@cornell.edu","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["safety","Sustainable","health care","hospital","Component","HHC","successful HHIs","Construct validity","Hand hygiene compliance","Hand hygiene research","Health services research","Research methods","Hand hygiene","Health care quality","Health care-associated infection","Space syntax","Noise","Visual cues","Message elaboration","Antimicrobial resistance","Antimicrobial management","Antibiotic prescription","Antibiotic usage","Persuasive interventions","Antibiotic resistance","future research","FIVEs","experimental","Interior","considerations","Virtual Environments","fully immersive","immersive virtual","virtual reality","visual clutter","cognitive capacity","psychiatric help-seeking","ambient scent","scent emission methods","affect intensity","eye-tracking","environmental psychology"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":84,"location":null,"raw_text":"Kalantari, S.; Neo, J.R.J.
