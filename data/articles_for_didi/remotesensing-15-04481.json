This article deals with the territory of the Malá Studená Dolina (Little Cold Valley, High Tatras National ParkSlovakia), where there are extensive talus cones, through which seasonally heavy hiking trails lead. In the last few years particularly, there have been frequent falls and landslides in the mountainous environment, which also caused several fatal injuries in 2018. For the above reasons, efforts are being made to develop a methodology for monitoring the changes of the talus cones in this specific alpine area, to determine the size, speed, and character of the morphological changes of the soil. Non-contact methods of mass data collection (laser scanning with Leica P40 and aerial photogrammetry with unmanned aerial system (UAS) DJI Phantom 4 Pro) have been used. The results of these measurements were compared and the overall suitability of both methods for measurement in such terrain evaluated. The standard deviation of the difference of surface determination (represented by the point cloud) is about 0.03 m. As such accuracy is sufficient for the purpose of monitoring talus cones and the use of UAS is easier and associated with lower risk of damage of expensive equipment, we conclude that this method is more suitable for mapping and for repeated monitoring of such terrain. The properties of the outputs of the individual measurement methods, the degree of measurement difficulty and specific measurement conditions in the mountainous terrain, as well as the economy of the individual methods, are discussed in detail.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/ijgi8080317","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Rudolf","last_name":"Urban","affiliations":[],"email":"rudolf.urban@fsv.cvut.cz","orcid":"","h_index":13,"keywords":["Point

Due to their relatively low purchase price and the fact they can be used to monitor areas that are difficult or even unsafe to access, they have been increasingly used in land surveying and mapping of smaller areas. Numerous UAV platforms equipped with various cameras are increasingly available on the market, differing in their suitability for environmental mapping. Surveyors therefore face a question whether to buy or assemble their own UAV. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of two fixed-wing UAV systems for land survey and mapping applications. In particular, we: (1) compared a commercial eBee platform equipped with a Sony Cybershot DSC-WX220 camera with zoom lens and a home assembled EasyStar II equipped with Nikon Coolpix A with a lens of fixed focal length to find out if a home-assembled solution can compete with specialized commercial platform; (2) investigated the utilization of UAV images acquired under leaf-off conditions for digital terrain model (DTM) generation with respect to vegetation cover (steppes and forests); (3) assessed whether an increase in the image quantity can compensate for a lower quality of images; and (4) compared the DTM derived from UAV imagery with the official Czech Republic airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived DTM. One flight with Easystar II and two perpendicular flights with eBee were performed. From these three flights, four point clouds were derived (one from each flight, and one resulting from a combination of two eBee flights), supplemented with four ground filtered point clouds. The accuracy of point clouds and DTM was assessed through a comparison with a conventional GNSS survey. We successfully identified the bare ground during the leaf-off period in the deciduous forest using images from both platforms. Point densities of point clouds acquired with Easystar II exceeded the densities of those acquired with eBee even after combining images from two eBee flights. Root mean square error of all derived point clouds ranged between 0.11 and 0.19 m, exceeding the accuracy of a nationwide ALS-derived DTM in both forest and open steppe areas. The most accurate point cloud was acquired using Easystar II. This is likely due to a combined effect of the quality of onboard cameras, camera settings and environmental conditions during the flight. For users who prefer to have greater control over their options rather than being dependent on the commercially available kit solution, home-assembled kits utilizing drones capable of carrying any camera available on the market may be an advantage.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1080/01431161.2018.1516311","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Vítězslav","last_name":"Moudrý","affiliations":[],"email":"moudry@fzp.czu.cz","orcid":"","h_index":21,"keywords":["spatial

Nowadays, in the scientific community, the use of these systems is not a novelty, but a deeper analysis of the literature shows a lack of codified complex methodologies that can be used not only for scientific experiments but also for normal codified emergency operations. RPASs can acquire on-demand ultra-high-resolution images that can be used for the identification of active processes such as landslides or volcanic activities but can also define the effects of earthquakes, wildfires and floods. In this paper, we present a review of published literature that describes experimental methodologies developed for the study and monitoring of natural hazards.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5194/nhess-18-1079-2018","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Giordan","affiliations":[],"email":"daniele.giordan@irpi.cnr.it","orcid":"","h_index":22,"keywords":["Glacier

The area of interest, the Vratna dolina Valley, is located in the Mala Fatra Mountains in the northern part of Slovakia. Extensive mass movement deformations occurred in the surveyed area in 2014 induced by extreme precipitation events caused considerable damage. The Proxima software technology has been used to identify terrain elements using a precise digital terrain model (DTM) for the localisation of the debris flows head scarps. Precise DTM was derived from the airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The morphometric analysis of landslide area was carried out on four selected locations. Verification of numerical mapping was performed by comparing results to the field survey data through visual comparison and area computation. Supplementary data was used in the form of orthophoto mosaics. The used spatial analysis applied on ALS data shows a high coincidence with the detection of the head scarps by field surveying, particularly in the hard to access and afforested areas. The main advantage of this approach lies in the reduction of field surveying and in the possible detection of the terrain changes not found during field surveying.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.31577/geogrcas.2019.71.2.06","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Marek","last_name":"Fraštia","affiliations":[],"email":"marek.frastia@stuba.sk","orcid":"","h_index":3,"keywords":["Bouguer anomaly","cavity","crypt","data processing","gravimetry","interpretation"]},{"first_name":"Pavel","last_name":"Liščák","affiliations":[],"email":"pavel.liscak@geology.sk","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["Slope deformation inventory","GNSS – Global Navigation Satellite System","GIS – Geographic Information Systems","Map server","Socio-economic relevance","survey","landslide","Roads","Slovakia","plastic","village","clays","Part","Stabilized","Rainfalls","evolution","geoheritage","Geological","Historical and Cultural Landscape","protection","Diversity","Atlas","slope deformation","passport","Flysch","territories","slope failure","laser scanning","rock slide","Multi-Temporal InSAR, Sentinel-1","land subsidence","undermining"]},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Pauditš","affiliations":[],"email":"peter.paudits@geology.sk","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Diversity","Slovakia","Atlas","geological","slope deformation","passport","Flysch","territories","slope failure"]},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Bobáľ","affiliations":[],"email":"peter.bobal@yms.sk","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["airborne laser scanning","remote sensing","archaeology","feature detection","hill-shading"]},{"first_name":"Slavomír","last_name":"Sipina","affiliations":[],"email":"slavomir.sipina@yms.sk","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["airborne laser scanning","remote sensing","archaeology","feature detection","hill-shading"]},{"first_name":"Marián","last_name":"Marčiš","affiliations":[],"email":"marian.marcis@stuba.sk","orcid":"","h_index":4,"keywords":["3D models","Quality of 3d","Sfm Technology","Models Generated","deformation measurements","Gabion Walls","Walls Using","Image Based","Using Image","Photogrammetry","Deformation measurement","Flat slab","Strain","Load test.","Engineering","Introductions and Overviews","Engineering, other","fire propagation","Hausdorff","distance","optimal","data assimilation","Propagation Model","kiteboarding","videogrammetry","jump height measurement","wearable sensors","laser scanning","rock slide","Crowded","cultural heritage","Image Based Modelling","surveying","TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING","Timber Roof","trusses","Panorama stitching","Structured light scanner","Unfolding of 3D surfaces","Structure from Motion","model deformations"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":6,"location":null,"raw_text":"Fraštia, M.; Liščák, P.; Žilka, A.; Pauditš, P.; Bobál', P.; Hronček, S.; Sipina, S.; Ihring, P.; Marčiš, M.

Conventional spaceborne or airborne remote sensing platforms have their own merits and limitations. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a viable and inexpensive option for studying the cryospheric components at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions. UAVs are adaptable to various cryospheric research needs in terms of providing flexibility with data acquisition windows, revisits, data/sensor types (multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, thermal/night imaging, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and photogrammetric stereos), viewing angles, flying altitudes, and overlap dimensions. Thus, UAVs have the potential to act as a bridging remote sensing platform between spatially discrete in situ observations and spatially continuous but coarser and costlier spaceborne or conventional airborne remote sensing. In recent years, a number of studies using UAVs for cryospheric research have been published. However, a holistic review discussing the methodological advancements, hardware and software improvements, results, and future prospects of such cryospheric studies is completely missing. In the present scenario of rapidly changing global and regional climate, studying cryospheric changes using UAVs is bound to gain further momentum and future studies will benefit from a balanced review on this topic. Our review covers the most recent applications of UAVs within glaciology, snow, permafrost, and polar research to support the continued development of high-resolution investigations of cryosphere. We also analyze the UAV and sensor hardware, and data acquisition and processing software in terms of popularity for cryospheric applications and revisit the existing UAV flying regulations in cold regions of the world. The recent usage of UAVs outlined in 103 case studies provide expertise that future investigators should base decisions on.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/rs12060948","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Clare B.","last_name":"Gaffey","affiliations":[],"email":"cgaffey@clarku.edu","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["sUAS","cryospheric","latitudes","polar","adaptations","viable","remote sensing","high latitude","efforts","Sea ice","Chlorophyll","Phytoplankton","Spring","Sea water","Pigments","Water columns","UAV","unmanned aerial systems (UAS)","drone","cryosphere","arctic"]},{"first_name":"Anshuman","last_name":"Bhardwaj","affiliations":[],"email":"anshuman.teri@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":21,"keywords":["Debris cover","Degree-day factor","Discharge","Mass balance","Snow and ice melt","Water availability","Geodynamics","Geomorphology","Science","Humanities and Social Sciences","multidisciplinary","Cryospheric science","Environmental health","Environmental impact","Palaeoclimate","Bilare Banga glacier","Hydro-geochemistry","Cations","Anions","Carbonate weathering","evolutions","models","topographic controls","Himalayan glaciers","rivers","climatic","responses","climate","regional scale","changes in glacier","viable","chapter","recent studies","extent","glacial","HKH","Geographical Information System","livelihood","study land degradation","GIS","mountains","geospatial techniques","astrobiology","3D-mapping","COTS","mining","Rover development","Naradu Glacier","Mars","Viking programme","planetary exploration","remote sensing","water resources","melt","Central","rainfall","drought","model","IWRM","basin","snow","Tajikistan","hydrology","Himachal Pradesh","Glacio","Shaune Garang Basin","Sediment load","Pro-glacial river discharge","Temperature","Shaune Garang catchment","Western Himalaya","Analog research","subsurface","technology","resolution","Aerial","DEM generation","Push Broom Camera","Landsat","velocity estimation","Differential","flow","Extremely","debris covered","Large Geographical","Estimate Glacier","Hydropower","renewable energy","Himalaya","Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency","changing climate","Glacier Inventory","Siachen Glacier","Study Reports","Glacier Using","Temporal Semi","Glacier","Glaciology","Ice sheets","UAV","slope streaks","water activity","formation mechanism","deliquescence","orbital model","rational functions model (RFM)","rational polynomial coefficients (RPC)","digital elevation model (DEM)","Cartosat-1, accuracy assessment","Active Microwave","Mountain Snow","Snow Using","Microwave Sensors","Sensing of Mountain","dem","ASTER GDEM","Srtm X-band Dem","Nrsc Cartodem","Slope","aspect","land cover","accuracy","Error","seasonal snow cover","hypsometry","interpolation","meteorology","crevasses","glacier dynamics","Himalayan","orientations","temporal","automated","band","detection","Ladakh","tourism","environment","climate change","glaciers","Topography","CB Basin","surveys were carried","Eastern Himalaya","Glacier Surface Velocity","and Remote sensing","RSL","Dunes","Radiation modelling","Science Autonomy","In-situ resource utilisation","Bird flock","Cluster formation","Flock echelon","Eurasian oystercatcher","Haematopus ostralegus ostralegus","High winds","Storm Malik","glacier mass balance","regional atmospheric circulations","hypsometric index","hypsometric integral","frontal retreat rate","swiss alps","permafrost","MODIS","ice avalanche","Chamoli","debris flow","rapid mass movement simulation (RAMMS)","co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr)","glacier velocity","high mountain","disaster","hazard sequence","mass movement mechanics","planetary remote sensing","mass wasting","mass movement","the Moon","Luna","Ceres","landslides","landscape evolution","Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC)","Dawn spacecraft","debris cover glacier","deep neural network","semantic segmentation","SAR","glacial geomorphology","glacier recession","VOLTA","ice thickness distribution","lake formation","ground-penetrating radar (GPR)","Segment Anything Model (SAM)","agriculture","vegetation","urban green spaces","aerial imaging","unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Sentinel-2","Mapping uncertainty","Hindu Kush-Himalaya","Debris-covered glacier","adaptable","seismic precursors","anomalies","possibilities","using non seismic","earthquake predictions","valley network","outflow channel","Flood susceptibility mapping","ANFIS","Genetic algorithm (GA)","Differential evolution (DE)","Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Metaheuristic optimization","Middle ganga plain","inventory","xmlns","svg","Multitemporal","sup","http"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":11,"location":null,"raw_text":"Gaffey, C.; Bhardwaj, A.

Due to climate changes, the frequency of glacial hazards such as glacial lake outbursts floods is increasing, and consequently, the mass of Iran's glaciers is decreasing. Fieldwork in high-altitude mountains is difficult, thus, the dynamics of debriscovered glaciers and their associated driving factors are poorly studied. In this study, changes in the elevation and the surface flow speed of the largest and most dynamic debris-covered glacier in Iran (Alamkouh glacier) are evaluated during 2018 to 2020 for the first time. For this purpose, images from a high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are used. Additionally, the spatial distribution of glacier ice thickness is estimated based on the principles of ice-flow and glacier surface velocity data. The distribution of ice thickness is evaluated with in-situ Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) data. The acquired high-resolution images from UAV are processed into a digital elevation model (with a spatial resolution of about 15 cm) and orthoimages (with a spatial resolution of about 8 cm), and glacier ice thickness change and surface flow velocity are derived. In order to estimate glacier surface velocity, a frequency cross-correlation model was applied using the COSI-Corr module. Our results show that the mean glacier ice thinning during the study period 20182020 is about 0.23 ± 0.03 m yr1 and it reaches about 5 ± 0.65 m yr1 at the terminus and accumulation areas. The observed variations in ice thinning are best explained by the existence of debris cover (and their corresponding insulating effects), the existence of ice cliffs, and their associated supraglacial lakes. We found that ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than average. Moreover, the mean surface velocity of Alamkouh glacier is about 1.1 ± 0.06 m yr1 from 2018 to 2020 with considerable spatial variation in surface velocities. The maximum surface velocity (about 4.5 ± 0.27 m yr1) belongs to its upper regions, and lower and marginal areas are nearly stagnant. The slow movement of the glacier, along with a continuous increase in debris and ice thinning, provides a suitable condition for supraglacial pond development, which decreases glacier mass. Total volume of glacier was estimated to be ~102 × 106 m3 in 2020, corresponding to an average ice thickness of ~31.3 ± 7.5 m. Moreover, the average ice thinning rate is 0.66% yr1 in 2018 to 2020. According to this reduction rate, it is expected that more than 51.7% of the glacier will be lost by the end of the 21st century.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.107855","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Neamat","last_name":"Karimi","affiliations":[],"email":"nehmatkarimi@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":13,"keywords":["Climate change","Groundwater balance","WA +","Remote sensing","FAO’s WaPOR product","Plasjan basin","Unmanned aerial vehicle","Debris-covered Glacier","Ice thinning","Surface velocity","Ice thickness","Artificial neural network","MODIS","Suspended sediment","Caspian Sea","Syria","resolution","Iraq","middle","Dust Storms","Source Points","plus","sup","Alamkouh glacier","maximum reduction","change analysis","semi arid environments","ice","SATELLITE","Glacier","Haft","Khan","clean ice regions","ice area change","glacier fluctuations","glacier mass balance","mountain glaciers","Groundwater level","Land subsidence","Radar image","Aquifer-system compaction","Inter bed Storage","Deforestation","Landsat","Spectral mixture analysis","Jangal-Abr","model","Middle East","dust source identification","AOD","Dust","AERONET","Ahvaz","Mesopotamia","Lake Urmia","Aerosol optical depth","Salt","Air quality","Dust storm","TRMM","Precipitation","Temperature","Synoptic analysis","digital elevation model","Debris-free area","Elevation changes","Supraglacial lakes","desertification","Lockdown","Air pollutants","Meteorological Data","Urmia Lake","In situ measurements","Bathymetry","Water depth","Water level","SARA","Desert surfaces","Glacier Surface Velocity","Image Resolution","UAV","Debris-covered glaciers","COSI-Corr","Manual Digitization","Crop type","Object based image analysis","Segmentation","NDVI","NDWI","Glacier Surface Temperature (GST)","Temporal Changes","Spatial Analysis","Climate Variable","part","surveyed","GSV","Iran","resolution satellite","Debris cover","Elevation change"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":12,"location":null,"raw_text":"Karimi, N.; Sheshangosht, S.; Roozbahani, R.

Ice surface roughness is dynamic as a consequence of spatial and temporal variation in ablation. To date, studies relying on singular and/or spatially discrete two-dimensional profiles to describe ice surface roughness have failed to resolve common patterns or causes of variation in glacier surface morphology. Here we demonstrate the potential of close-range digital photogrammetry as a rapid and cost-effective method to retrieve three-dimensional data detailing plot-scale supraglacial topography. The photogrammetric approach here employed a calibrated, consumer-grade 5 Mpix digital camera repeatedly imaging a plot-scale (25 m2) ice surface area on Midtre Lovénbreen, Svalbard. From stereo-pair images, digital surface models (DSMs) with sub-centimetre horizontal resolution and 3 mm vertical precision were achieved at plot scales 4 m2. Extraction of roughness metrics including estimates of aerodynamic roughness length (z 0) was readily achievable, and temporal variations in the glacier surface topography were captured. Close-range photogrammetry, with appropriate camera calibration and image acquisition geometry, is shown to be a robust method to record sub-centimetre variations in ablating ice topography. While the DSM plot area may be limited through use of stereo-pair images and issues of obliquity, emerging photogrammetric packages are likely to overcome such limitations","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3189/2014jog14j032","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tristram D.

Ice covers on a river surface cause resistance to water flow, which increases upstream water levels. Ice with a higher degree of roughness causes increased flow resistance and therefore even higher upstream water levels. Aerial images collected via remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) were processed with structure from motion photogrammetry to create a digital elevation model (DEM) and then produce quantitative measurements of surface ice roughness. Images and surface ice roughness values were collected over 2 years on the Dauphin River in Manitoba, Canada. It was hypothesized that surface ice roughness would be indicative of subsurface ice roughness. This hypothesis was tested by comparing RPA-measured surface ice roughness values to those predicted by the Nezhikhovskiy equation, wherein subsurface ice roughness is proportional to ice thickness. Various statistical metrics were used to represent the roughness height of the DEMs. Strong trends were identified in the comparison of RPA-measured ice surface roughness to subsurface ice roughness values predicted by the Nezhikhovskiy equation, as well as with comparisons to ice thickness. The standard deviation and interquartile range of roughness heights were determined to be the most representative statistical metrics and several properties of the DEMs of fluvial ice covers were calculated and observed. No DEMs were found to be normally distributed. This first attempt at using RPA-derived measurements of surface ice roughness to estimate river ice flow resistance is shown to have considerable potential and will hopefully be verified and improved upon by subsequent measurements on a wide variety of rivers and ice covers.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5194/tc-15-4031-2021","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Shawn P.","last_name":"Clark","affiliations":[],"email":"shawn.clark@umanitoba.ca","orcid":"","h_index":7,"keywords":["structure","damage","Red River","ice","magnitude","Experienced","Flood Event","Acoustic Doppler current profiler","field studies","ice covered rivers","particle-laden flows","sediment transport","suspended sediments","velocity measurements","water quality","Acoustic Doppler velocimeter","offset jet","reattached flows","Reynolds stress","submerged jet","surface roughness","Border ice","River-ice engineering","Shear stress","Channel hydraulics","Acoustic Doppler velocimetry","Roughness effects","River ice","Shoving","Field measurements","Water level","Ice thickness","Actively consolidating zone","Bed shear stress","coherent structures","ice jam","pressure gradient","stress","surge","ice cover","ice dynamics","consolidation","events","unsteady flow","water levels","Lower Dauphin","Partial ice cover","Shear stress distribution","Velocity distribution","Hydraulics","Numerical simulation","model","air temperature","Simulations","freeze","crust","ice cover formation","safety","optical","streamflow","Machine Learning Based","Surface Velocimetry","channel sidewall","coverage ratio","secondary flow","partial ice-covers","PIV","RANS modelling","secondary currents","bedload","ice-covered channel","asymmetric border ice","hanging dam formation and evolution","physical modelling","incoming ice supply rate","approach Froude number","river ice engineering","ice transport","ice deposition","critical shear stress","bathymetry","Cohesive Sediment","Sediment Erosion and Deposition Rates","Wide Rivers","Estimate Cohesive","erosion","Total suspended solids","Sediment","Entropy","ADCP","Morphodynamics","diversion channels","wave","current","morphodynamique","canaux de dérivation","vague","courrant","sédiments cohésifs","fluvial ice covers","flow resistance","ice roughness","roughness estimation"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":15,"location":null,"raw_text":"Ehrman, J.; Clark, S.; Wall, A.

In this study, we develop a method to estimate ice cliff volume losses based on high-resolution topographic data derived from terrestrial and aerial photogrammetry. We apply our method to six cliffs monitored in May and October 2013 and 2014 using four different topographic datasets collected over the debris-covered Lirung Glacier of the Nepalese Himalayas. During the monsoon, the cliff mean backwasting rate was relatively consistent in 2013 (3.8 ± 0.3 cm w.e. d1) and more heterogeneous among cliffs in 2014 (3.1 ± 0.7 cm w.e. d1), and the geometric variations between cliffs are larger. Their mean backwasting rate is significantly lower in winter (October 2013May 2014), at 1.0 ± 0.3 cm w.e. d1. These results are consistent with estimates of cliff ablation from an energy-balance model developed in a previous study. The ice cliffs lose mass at rates six times higher than estimates of glacier-wide melt under debris, which seems to confirm that ice cliffs provide a large contribution to total glacier melt.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1017/jog.2016.54","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Fanny","last_name":"Brun","affiliations":[],"email":"fanny.brun@ujf-grenoble.fr","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["debris-covered

In this study, the spatial and temporal flow patterns of perennially frozen debris in the active Gran Sometta rock glacier (Western Italian Alps) were investigated with repeated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) surveys (20162019), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) campaigns (20122020), geophysical prospections (2015) and ground surface temperature data (20142020). UAV data were used to generate maps of changes and elevation differences of the rock glacier surface by 3D point cloud comparison to evaluate surface lowering and accumulation processes. Horizontal velocities were quantified by an automatic image correlation technique and the results were then compared with horizontal surface velocities from GNSS measurements on selected points. The horizontal velocities estimated with the automatic method agree well with the GNSS velocities with an R2 = 0.99 and a RMSE lower than 0.07 m/y. Point cloud comparisons show surface lowering in the orographic left-hand side of the terminal part and in the central body of the rock glacier. The upper part exhibits almost absence of subsidence and any movement. This is explained by the lack of permafrost in this sector due to its overriding by the development of a small glacier during the Little Ice Age. As a result of the downslope movement, zones of surface rising occurred at the advancing front and at the moving ridge and furrow complexes. Surface velocity decreases from the orographic left to the right-hand side of the rock glacier tongue, where a thaw subsidence of up to 0.05 m/y was also observed. According to the GNSS measurements, the range of flow velocity of the rock glacier increased from 0.171.1 m/y in 2013 to 0.211.45 m/y in 2015 and then decreased until 2018 when the smallest surface velocity is detected. Since 2018, the creep velocities gradually started to increase again reaching values of 0.23 m/y up to a maximum of 1.9 m/y in the orographic left-hand side of the rock glacier tongue. This agrees with observations from other rock glaciers in the European Alps in recent decades. The complex Gran Sometta rock glacier dynamics can be explained by the heterogeneous distribution of permafrost and related subsurface perennially frozen ground which is thick enough (about 2030 m) for permafrost creep to occur. Creep rates of the rock glacier permafrost depend also on the ground thermal regime: annual warmer surface conditions promote an acceleration of the creep rates within the rock glacier permafrost, whereas ground surface cooling causes a slight deceleration.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108116","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Francesca","last_name":"Bearzot","affiliations":[],"email":"f.bearzot@campus.unimib.it","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["structure","permafrost","Model","glacier","GNSS

It remains a challenge to monitor snow-surface processes due to its tough environment. In this study, a novel One-camera Time-lapse Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry system (O-T-SfM), which is achieved by mounted a camera on a slider to take seven images from different viewing angles, was build-up to monitor snow surface automatically. The novel O-T-SfM was installed next to the August-one ice cap in the Qilian mountains, northwestern China to monitor snow-surface processes by taking oblique digital photographs every three hours from 8:00 to 17:00 from August 24, 2019, to September 7, 2020. Agisoft Photoscan was used to process the images and to derive point clouds and plot 1.5 × 1.5 m scale digital elevation models (DEMs). The O-T-SfM measurements is highly consistent with three different methods such as manual measurement, checkpoints, and manual photogrammetry, which indicates that O-T-SfM photogrammetry can achieve centimeter-scale precision. We found that O-T-SfM photogrammetry was generally successful at monitoring snow surfaces and the performance varies with the variation of surface condition in different season. Best performance was reached with snow-free conditions and O-T-SfM has a good performance when snow bedforms were abundant from October to March. It is hard for O-T-SfM to capture the snow melting processes July to September and the smooth fresh snowfalls from April to June. Alignment achievement was greatest in the morning and declined throughout the day. We found that our digital DEMs could also be used to assess the settling characteristics of the snowpack (snow accumulation and ablation, snow-surface roughness). Our results suggest that remote O-T-SfM photogrammetry can be successfully used to monitor the snow processes.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.coldregions.2021.103355","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Rensheng","last_name":"Chen","affiliations":[],"email":"crs2008@lzb.ac.cn","orcid":"","h_index":17,"keywords":["Threshold","rain","air

In such cases a visual-based approach can be used to produce, both the followed path and the 3D model of the hypogeal environment. A prompt photogrammetric survey has been used to reconstruct the morphology of the La Sassa Cave, situated in the municipality of Sonnino (Latina), in the lower Lazio region. In this cave, a very large quantity of Pleistocene animal bones was found, together with several fragments of Copper Age human bones and Bronze Age impasto potsherds. The survey was carried out using a DSLR full frame camera Nikon D800E with a Nikkor 16 mm fisheye lens pre-calibrated. During the acquisition, several targets were measured in order to contain the deformations model. The photogrammetric model has been georeferenced using 3 GCPs positioned outside the cave entrance where a double frequency GNSS receiver has acquired data in static session mode.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5194/isprs-archives-xlii-2-w9-25-2019","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Luca","last_name":"Alessandri","affiliations":[],"email":"l.alessandri@rug.nl","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["Briquetage","Central Italy","Early states","Radiocarbon dating","Carbonates","Organic matter","Neotectonics","Apennines","Pleistocene","Copper age","Early and middle bronze age","Landscape archaeology","Protoappenninico and grotta nuova","Bronze Age","nitrogen","isotopes","Italian","Central","evidence","MBA","mobility","Diet","Teeth","Italian people","Strontium","Isotope analysis","Mandible","Radioactive carbon dating","survey","cave","georeferencing","fisheye lens","model","photogrammetric","SASSA","frame","Photogrammetry","Structure from motion","Cultural heritage","3D modelling","La Sassa cave","Guattari cave","GCPs","CAMERAS","two models","MOBILE PHONE","Iron Age Italy","Magnetometry","Corings","Intensive survey","Salt production in antiquity","Islands","Salting out","Archaeology","Lagoons","Sediment","Ceramics","Crystals"]},{"first_name":"Valerio","last_name":"Baiocchi","affiliations":[],"email":"valerio.baiocchi@uniroma1.it","orcid":"","h_index":12,"keywords":["Albano","Nemi","dTm","Als Survey","Gnss/rtk","georeferencing","Italian datums","Military Geographic Institute","IGM","Monte Mario","Rome","Cadastre","Italy","Geodetic datums","Map grids","Geoinformation","buildings","surveying","UAVs","post","flight","structures","extreme","L'Aquila","earthquake","damaged","Fibrous amphibole","Fluoro-edenite","Mesothelioma","Biancavilla","Mt.

Its specific origin is determined by particular lithological and hydrogeological conditions of the Ochtiná karst formed in lenses of Paleozoic crystalline limestones, partly metasomatically altered to ankerite and siderite. Although the cave is only 300 m long, it represents a combined labyrinth consisting in parallel tectonically controlled halls and passages, that are largely interconnected through transverse conduits of phreatic and epiphreatic morphology with many medium- and small-scale forms originated in slowly moving or standing water (flat solution ceilings, wall inward-inclined facets, water table notches, convectional cupolas, and spongework-like hollows). The highly dissected and irregular morphologies of the cave were surveyed with terrestrial laser scanning and digital photogrammetry. Both used surveying technologies proved to be suitable for quick and accurate mapping of the complicated cave pattern. While terrestrial laser scanning can provide a rapid survey of larger and more complex areas with results delivered directly in the field, digital photogrammetry is able to generate very high-resolution models with quality photo-texture for mapping of small-scale morphologies. Several data on cave morphometry were generated from terrestrial laser scanning (e.g., the area of cave ground plan, the peripheral surface of underground spaces, and their volume). The new detailed map, sections, and 3D model create an innovation platform for a more detailed study on the morphology and genesis of this unusual cave also for its environmental protection and use in tourism.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/app10134633","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Katarína","last_name":"Pukanská","affiliations":[],"email":"katarina.pukanska@tuke.sk","orcid":"","h_index":7,"keywords":["photogrammetry","cultural

Traditional adopted techniques allow a simplified acquisition of the topography of caves characterized by an oversimplification of the geometry. Nowadays, the advent of LiDAR and Structure from Motion applications eased three-dimensional surveys in different environments. In this paper, we present a comparison between other three-dimensional survey systems, namely a Terrestrial Laser Scanner, a SLAM-based portable instrument, and a commercial photo camera, to test their possible deployment in natural caves survey. We presented a comparative test carried out in a tunnel stretch to calibrate the instrumentation on a benchmark site. The choice of the site is motivated by its regular geometry and easy accessibility. According to the result obtained in the calibration site, we presented a methodology, based on the Structure from Motion approach that resulted in the best compromise among accuracy, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness, that could be adopted for the three-dimensional survey of complex natural caves using a sequence of images and the structure from motion algorithm. The methods consider two different approaches to obtain a low resolution complete three-dimensional model of the cave and ultra-detailed models of most peculiar cave morphological elements. The proposed system was tested in the Gazzano Cave (Piemonte region, Northwestern Italy). The obtained result is a three-dimensional model of the cave at low resolution due to the sites extension and the remarkable amount of data. Additionally, a peculiar speleothem, i.e., a stalagmite, in the cave was surveyed at high resolution to test the proposed high-resolution approach on a single object. The benchmark and the cave trials allowed a better definition of the instrumentation choice for underground surveys regarding accuracy and feasibility.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/app11146482","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Daniele","last_name":"Giordan","affiliations":[],"email":"daniele.giordan@irpi.cnr.it","orcid":"","h_index":22,"keywords":["Glacier

However, mapping alpine topography at very detailed scales is challenging due to limited accessibility of sites. Close-range sensing by photogrammetric dense matching approaches based on terrestrial images captured with hand-held cameras offers a light-weight and low-cost solution to retrieve high-resolution measurements even in steep terrain and at locations, which are difficult to access. We propose a novel approach for rapid capturing of terrestrial images and a highly automated processing chain for retrieving detailed dense point clouds for topographic modelling. For this study, we modelled 249 plot locations. For the analysis of vegetation distribution and location properties, topographic parameters, such as slope, aspect, and potential solar irradiation were derived by applying a multi-scale approach utilizing voxel grids and spherical neighbourhoods. The result is a micro-topography archive of 249 alpine locations that includes topographic parameters at multiple scales ready for biogeomorphological analysis. Compared with regional elevation models at larger scales and traditional 2D gridding approaches to create elevation models, we employ analyses in a fully 3D environment that yield much more detailed insights into interrelations between topographic parameters, such as potential solar irradiation, surface area, aspect and roughness.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jag.2017.11.011","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Niederheiser","affiliations":[],"email":"robert.niederheiser@oeaw.ac.at","orcid":"","h_index":4,"keywords":["packages","software","modelling","sensors","rock","Terrestrial","point

Different failure mechanisms may be possible depending on the influence of the engineering properties of the rock mass (including the fracture network), the persistence and type of discontinuity and the relative aspect or orientation of the coastline. Using a section of the North Coast of Cornwall, UK, as an example we present a multi-disciplinary approach for characterizing landslide risk associated with coastal instabilities in a blocky rock mass. Remotely captured terrestrial and aerial LiDAR and photogrammetric data were interrogated using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to provide a framework for subsequent analysis, interpretation and validation. The remote sensing mapping data was used to define the rock mass discontinuity network of the area and to differentiate between major and minor geological structures controlling the evolution of the North Coast of Cornwall. Kinematic instability maps generated from aerial LiDAR data using GIS techniques and results from structural and engineering geological surveys are presented. With this method, it was possible to highlight the types of kinematic failure mechanism that may generate coastal landslides and highlight areas that are more susceptible to instability or increased risk of future instability. Multi-temporal aerial LiDAR data and orthophotos were also studied using GIS techniques to locate recent landslide failures, validate the results obtained from the kinematic instability maps through site observations and provide improved understanding of the factors controlling the coastal geomorphology. The approach adopted is not only useful for academic research, but also for local authorities and consultancy's when assessing the likely risks of coastal instability.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jag.2017.12.016","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Mirko","last_name":"Francioni","affiliations":[],"email":"mirko.francioni@uniurb.it","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["numerical

One is the emergence of medium and long range terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) technology that can collect high point density with unprecedented accuracy and speed, and two, the expanding sphere of multidisciplinary research in understanding the origin and development of cave, called speleogenesis. Accurate surveying of caves has always been fundamental to understanding their origin and processes that lead to their current state and as well provide tools and information to predict future. Several laser scanning surveys have been carried out in many sophisticated cave sites around the world over the last decade for diverse applications; however, no comprehensive assessment of this development has been published to date. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) scanning in caves during the last decade. It examines a bibliography of almost fifty high quality works published in various international journals related to mapping caves in their true 3D geometry with focus on sensor design, methodology and data processing, and application development. The study shows that a universal standard method for 3D scanning has been established. The method provides flexible procedures that make it adaptable to suit different geometric conditions in caves. Significant progress has also been recorded in terms of physical design and technical capabilities. Over time, TLS devices have seen a reduction in size, and become more compact and lighter, with almost full panoramic coverage. Again, the speed, resolution, and measurement accuracy of scanners have improved tremendously, providing a wealth of information for the expanding sphere of emerging applications. Comparatively, point cloud processing packages are not left out of the development. They are more efficient in terms of handling large data volume and reduced processing time with advanced and more powerful functionalities to visualize and generate different products.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5038/1827-806x.45.1.1923","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Biswajeet","last_name":"Pradhan","affiliations":[],"email":"biswajeet24@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":108,"keywords":["lung

The aim of this paper is to show how photogrammetry can be a valid and reliable techniques for creating 3D models of museum artefacts even in case of objects with materials featuring difficult optical properties (absorptivity, reflectivity, scattering), challenging texture and complex shape/geometry. The main objective is to establish some core specifications for data acquisition and modeling, in order to guarantee the scientific quality of data and the interoperability of 3D models with the archaeologists and conservators. All these aspects are taken into consideration and presented with three study cases (two statues  one made of marble and one made of bronze  and a restored ceramic jug). The established, comprehensive and accessible pipeline for the creation of complex artefacts 3D models in the field of cultural heritage is presented and

Specifically, the Italian scholar advocates for the complete reversibility of restoration work and respect for the history of an artwork. Indeed, according to these concepts, all interventions should be fully reversible so to return the object to its initial conditions without any damage. Bearing in mind these assumptions, a detailed documentation of all the steps of the conservation process, and the possibility to retrieve them a posteriori, must be considered essential. This concept especially applies when dealing with paintings restoration characterized by fine and small details. In recent years, the tendency is to favour minimal invasive interventions ranging from consolidation actions, cleaning samples, and colours retouching. Materials change more or less conspicuously over time according to their consistency and the intensity of the changing factors. Icons do not make an exception to this rule. This process affects the icons whole structure: the support, the painting itself and the varnish coating. This paper investigates the performance of change detection algorithms, developed in the remote sensing domain, and, in the framework of this research applied at a microscale (paintings). Each phase of the restoration process is documented exploiting a multi-epoch image acquisition. A monitoring methodology coupled with photogrammetry and 3D shape analysis is tested and described. It is anticipated that the proposed innovative use of change detection techniques can be applied to different kinds of painted surfaces. An icon, today preserved at the Byzantine Museum Makarios III Foundation in Nicosia and restored by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus labs, has been used as a case study.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1186/s40494-019-0257-y","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Dante","last_name":"Abate","affiliations":[],"email":"d.abate@cyi.ac.cy","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["Bundle Adjustment","photogrammetric","reconstruction","models","Aerial","DATASET COLLECTED","kites","software","PLATFORM","Fragments","Recomposition","Photogrammetry","2D feature detector","Homography","3D modelling","Surveying","WebGIS","Awareness-Raising","Education","First World War","War heritage","contaminated","crime scene","low cost","cloud","registration","documentation","Forensic archaeology","Digital technologies","Geophysics","Missing persons","Ground penetrating radar","Restoration","Icon","Painting","Change detection","Built heritage","remote sensing","MAD/MAF","archaeology","Byzantine church","monastery","UNESCO","Cyprus","relief visualization","digital-elevation models","looting","cultural property protection","3D modeling","web","Project Photofly","Autodesk","convert","ONLINE","summer","digital","remote rendering","high definition","cultural heritage","accuracy","archaeological","archaeologists","Ostia","scientific","excavation","Project","public","sharing","monitoring of paintings","artworks","bad conservation","World Wide Web","modelling","ARCHITECTURAL","South","Mediterranean","ENDANGERED","archaeological heritage","functioned","Roman","baths","documented","model","based","Europe","church","Original","fragmented","frescoes","walls","virtually","Locate","Re Composition","Future Display","contamination","detect changes","surveyed","PANORAMIC","Heliostat surface","Laser scanning","Ray-tracing","Flux prediction","Soil water erosion","Agricultural terrace","Mediterranean vineyard","Monitoring experiment","Sediment traps","Terrestrial laser scanning","visible","study graffiti","scientific community","surface","used","analysis","Artificial Intelligence","Social Media Intelligence","Dark Web","Illicit Traffic","Solid modeling","Rendering (computer graphics)","Computational modeling","Load modeling","Visualization","Servers","Glass","Three-dimensional displays","History","Biological system modeling","Holocaust","Aerial laser scanning","Web-based visualization","extreme environment","survey","LiDAR","contour","Antarctica","Italian","DEM"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":33,"location":null,"raw_text":"Abate, D.

The research presented is part of the e-thesaurus project whose main objective is to improve the accessibility of masterpieces of goldsmithing - produced during the medieval period in the northern regions of France and todays Belgium - both for research and mediation purposes. The methodology for 3D acquisition of objects with high levels of details and reflective properties must be further developed and affirmed in order provide controlled datasets that are suitable for researchers of the field and accurate for mediation application. The proposed project is the result of a collaboration between the IRHiS UMR CNRS of the University of Lille and the University of Liège. The proposed methodology leads to the 3D reconstruction of masterpieces of goldsmithing. The models developed serve as a basis for a mediation through holographic representation.

This method allows accurate calculation of both seasonal and annual mass balance, estimating the amount of ice inside caves. The ground-based SfM approach represents a low-cost workflow with very limited logistical problems of transportation and human resources and a fast acquisition time, all key factors in such extreme environments. Under optimal conditions, SfM-MVS allows sub-centimetric resolution results, comparable to more expensive and logistically demanding surveys such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Fourteen SfM acquisitions were made between the 2017-2020 ablation seasons (i.e. July-October) while 2 GPR surveys were acquired in 2012. The obtained dense point clouds and digital terrain models (DTMs) made possible a reliable calculation of topographic changes and mass balance rates during the analysed period. The integration of SfM-MVS products with GPR surveys provided comprehensive imaging of the ice thickness and the total ice volume present in each of the caves, proving to be a reliable, low cost and multipurpose methodology ideal for long-term monitoring.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1177/03091333211065123","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Renato R.","last_name":"Colucci","affiliations":[],"email":"renato.colucci@isp.cnr.it","orcid":"","h_index":18,"keywords":["glacier","mountain","exceeded","Alps","December","anomalies","unprecedented","ablation","winter","elevation","evolution","ice","Marmolada glacier","MHz","surveys","survive","GPR","two different","firn","snow","common offset","GPR data","frozen materials","methodology to estimate","extremes","Europe","Response of ice caves","resolution","LiDAR","rock glaciers","protalus ramparts","Mediterranean region","permafrost","Last Glacial Maximum","deglaciation","Holocene","Polje","Karst","Glaciation","Dinaric Alps","Rock glacier","Periglacial environment","Buried ice","Electrical resistivity tomography","very small glaciers","climatology","precipitation","climate change","temperature","general regression model","ELA","LIA","avalanche","very small glacier","climate","air‐sea interactions","heat fluxes","dense water formation","Adriatic Sea","Gulf of Trieste","offset","antennas","velocity analysis","amplitudes","synthetic and real data","Decision support systems","Indexes","Surface morphology","Surface topography","Data mining","Electromagnetics","Density measurement","Thickness measurement","Velocity measurement","Ground penetrating radar","volume/area scaling","water content","periglacial landforms","Density and volume estimation","Canin","Kanin","Glacieret","Mass balance","3D GPR","4D analysis","ice melting","time monitoring","climate changes","Triglav glacier","Slovenia","South-eastern Alps","Maritime glaciers","Little Ice Age","volume-area scaling","small glaciers","glacier mass balance","AMO","structure","GPR attribute analysis","resolution glacier","High resolution","Archive images","Photogrammetry","Mono-plotting","Glaciers","Julian Alps","Italy","ice caves","cryosphere","Depth","Time","series","observations","Trieste","Surface Sea Temperature","Quaternary","Glaciology","Barents sea","Ice sheet modelling","Ocean melting","lower temperatures","alpine","LGM","summer","climate model","regional climate","sup","century","time series","European Alps","Ice patch","Younger Dryas","sea level pressure","mean sea level","pressure time series","instruments","model","extent","RCM","extended","Pleistocene","Cosmogenic isotopes","Glacial geomorphology","Dinarides","PISM","Structure from motion","ice deposits","caves","SfM","simulations","Ocean","ice sheet","Primarily Driven","Simulated Last"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":42,"location":null,"raw_text":"Securo, A.; Forte, E.; Martinucci, D.; Pillon, S.; Colucci, R.R.

This study demonstrates how terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) can be used to fully and accurately (registration accuracy < 1 cm standard deviation of point differences) assess the geometry of an ice-bearing cave in the Eastern Alps (Tyrol, Austria). Three TLS campaigns and 255 scan positions were used to acquire point clouds with a high sampling density (2 cm average point spacing) in order to minimise shading effects and to assure a precise and highly resolved 3D documentation of the cave. A semi-automated registration and point cloud-processing approach adapted to the site-specific demands ensured a complete and error-minimised assessment of the cave's geometry serving as a solid basis for future quantifications of snow and ice content dynamics. Dominant cave surface structures were investigated by performing a multiscale principal component analysis (PCA) to identify a detailed and computationally efficient basis for future airflow modelling tasks.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1111/phor.12437","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jan","last_name":"Pfeiffer","affiliations":[],"email":"jan.pfeiffer@oeaw.ac.at","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["Catchment

In this study, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data of the ice-sheet margin in East Antarctica were collected and analysed, an average velocity of 0.18 m/ns was obtained through ice density conversion and common midpoint (CMP) survey. The thickness, internal layers, and bed elevation were used to determine the spatial characteristics of snow/firn in the survey area. The relative amplitudes of the reflections along the bedrock interface were computed to determine the potential presence of subglacial water in depressions, which is the most likely source of strong reflections at basal interfaces. Because the subglacial topography is associated with the dynamic characteristics of the ice sheet, the two-parameter roughness index was used to assess the regional roughness of the bedrock beneath the snow/firn and discuss the implications of changes at the bottom. This research provides insights into the physical characteristics of ice-sheet margins. The methodology proposed in this study should be applied in the future to quantify the physical parameters required for ice-sheet studies.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jappgeo.2022.104816","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jingxue","last_name":"Guo","affiliations":[],"email":"guojingxue@pric.org.cn","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["neural network","East Antarctica","multi-sensor","LSTM","heat flux","Curie depth","aeromagnetic","subglacial geothermal","ice-penetrating radar","VMD","noise reduction","forward simulation","Antarctic","denoising","feature extraction","subglacial conditions","ice sheet","machine learning","ice-penetrating radar (IPR)","internal layering continuity index (ILCI)","roughness","ice dynamics","magnetotelluric","3D interpretation","the Prydz Bay","Chinese Zhongshan Station","unattended","long- and short-term memory","lumped parameter method","Snow Eagle 601","aerogeophysics","Princess Elizabeth Land","Antarctic ice sheet","airborne gravity gradient","seafloor topography","admittance","simulated annealing","Indo-Antarctic","subglacial bedrock","tectonic","airborne","gravity","magnetic","inversion","Ionosphere","second-order ionospheric term","GPS positioning","Antarctica","Antarctic glaciology","glaciological instruments and methods","radio-echo sounding","Applied glaciology","ground-penetrating radar","polar firn","seismic","wave","Uppermost Crustal Structures","structures","icequakes","Dalk Glacier","Larsemann","Hills","msub","Noise","evolution","sutures","Prydz","Moho","Neoproterozoic","Cambrian","evidence","function","Geophysical","Belt","nodal seismic array","receiver function","magnetotellurics","prydz belt","Larsemann Hills","bathymetry","Amery Ice Shelf¸ airborne gravity","ice-ocean interaction","gravity inversion"]},{"first_name":"Lin","last_name":"Li","affiliations":[],"email":"lilin@pric.org.cn","orcid":"","h_index":3,"keywords":["heat flux","Curie depth","aeromagnetic","subglacial geothermal","East Antarctica","Lambert Glacier","remote sensing data","ice flux","mass balance","BedMachine v2","Landsat-8","ice-penetrating radar","denoising","feature extraction","subglacial conditions","ice sheet","machine learning","ice-penetrating radar (IPR)","internal layering continuity index (ILCI)","roughness","ice dynamics","Snow Eagle 601","aerogeophysics","Princess Elizabeth Land","Antarctic ice sheet","Indo-Antarctic","subglacial bedrock","tectonic","airborne","gravity","magnetic","inversion"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":45,"location":null,"raw_text":"Guo, J.; Li, L.; Liu, J.; Fu, L.; Tang, X.; Wang, Y.; Yang, W.; Dou, Y.; Liu, S.; Lu, Q.; et al.

MVE is an end-to-end multi-view geometry reconstruction software which takes photos of a scene as input and produces a textured surface mesh as result. The system covers a structure-from-motion algorithm, multi-view stereo reconstruction, generation of extremely dense point clouds, reconstruction of surfaces from point clouds, and surface texturing. In contrast to most image-based geometry reconstruction approaches, our system is focused on reconstruction of multi-scale scenes, an important aspect in many areas such as cultural heritage. It allows to reconstruct large datasets containing some detailed regions with much higher resolution than the rest of the scene. Our system provides a graphical user interface for visual inspection of the individual steps of the pipeline, i.e., the structure-from-motion result, multi-view stereo depth maps, and rendering of scenes and

So far, the emergence of these novel methods has not been supported by the definition of an internationally recognized standard which is fundamental for user confidence and market growth. In order to provide an element of reflection and solution to the different communities involved in 3D imaging, a promising approach is presented in this paper for the assessment of both metric quality and limitations of an open-source suite of tools (Apero/MicMac), developed for the extraction of dense 3D point clouds from a set of unordered 2D images. The proposed procedural workflow is performed within a metrological context, through inter-comparisons with \"reference\" data acquired with two hemispherical laser scanners, one total station, and one laser tracker. The methodology is applied to two case studies, designed in order to analyse the software performances in dealing with both outdoor and environmentally controlled conditions, i.e. the main entrance of Cathédrale de la Major (Marseille, France) and a custom-made scene located at National Research Council of Canada 3D imaging Metrology Laboratory (Ottawa). Comparative data and accuracy evidence produced for both tests allow the study of some key factors affecting 3D model accuracy.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5194/isprsannals-ii-5-371-2014","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Isabella","last_name":"Toschi","affiliations":[],"email":"toschi@fbk.eu","orcid":"","h_index":12,"keywords":["modeling","Reconstruction","laser","dense","discussed","image based","software capabilities","accuracy evidence","models","oriented","point clouds","test objects","validation tests","simplified","calibration","procedure","surveyed","adapt","Gaussian","historic","surveys","statistical","errors","normal","System","model","imaging","National Research","affecting 3D","hemispherical laser","3D surface","building","damage","structures","classification","resolution","earthquake","airborne","Automated processes","urban scenarios","complex urban","city centre","oblique photogrammetry","modelling of complex","geometry","developments","management","information","city","data","photogrammetric","cloud","execution","GSD","semi oblique","flight","3D modelling","Surveying","WebGIS","Awareness-Raising","Education","First World War","War heritage","contaminated","crime scene","low cost","registration","documentation","survey","Decision making","sensing","hazards","sensors","Geomatics","crisis","Procedures","efficient","solutions","contamination","detect changes","original","PANORAMIC","power line mapping","promising","anomaly","automatically","solution","LiDAR","hazardous","UAV","Rapid Mapping","Geomatics technique","sensor and multi","primarily focused","oblique","CityMapper","w.r.t","concurrent","Hybrid sensor","LiDAR data","camera","Czech Republic","GNSS","image matching","Imst","urban areas","landslide","terrestrial","image","integration","practices","Oblique Aerial Imagery","AERIAL IMAGERY FOR NMA","photogrammetry","automation","accuracy","precision","bundle adjustment","dense image matching","comparison","Graphos","Photogrammetric Tool","3D point clouds","landslide monitoring","Sentinel-1","DInSAR","Small BAseline Subset (SBAS)","DGNSS","South Tyrol","simulation","orientation","3D surveying","dem","Illumination Dome","surface reconstruction","structure","photometric","frequency detail","Fotogrametría aérea","extracción de edificios","geometrías complejas","sistemas de cartografiado móvil","análisis urbanístico","Digital Surface Model","orthophoto","supervised","unsupervised","damage assessment","Clouds","Laser scanners","Phase shifting","Statistical analysis","computer-aided teaching (CAT)","computer vision","e-learning","open source","3D reconstruction"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":50,"location":null,"raw_text":"Toschi, I.; Capra, A.; De Luca, L.; Beraldin, J.-A.; Cournoyer, L.

Here we present another way to address these studies, applying some methods already used in fields other than geomorphology. The versatility and accuracy provided by the use of modern topography and thermography techniques, using Terrestrial Laser Scanner and current thermographic cameras- and the creation of 3D thermographic models and orthothermographies derived from them - is shown to be a useful tool as it is difficult to obtain data from fieldwork and traditional methods used in caves. This paper presents the potential uses of combined TLS and thermographic techniques for monitoring some important climatological parameters in the sensitive periglacial environment of the Iberian Atlantic high mountains: Peña Castil Ice Cave (Picos de Europa, Northern Spain). A systematic application of such combined technologies to these kind of caves, is expected to contribute to a quantitative and concise characterization of the evolution of the ice as shown by the

This phenomenon has been known about for a long time but is still scarcely studied from the point of view of its cryological values and the evolution and distribution of many of their morphologies. For this, the development of cryomorphological topographies from traditional techniques to geodetic surveys with different tools, including terrestrial laser scanning, is one of the most current ways to characterize and quantify this type of cryospheric phenomena. It represents a new kind of periglacial cartography whose use is feasible in spite of the difficulties these environments present.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/geosciences8080274","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"Gómez-Lende","affiliations":[],"email":"manuelglende@hotmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["Palabras Clave Geomtica","Laderas","Periglaciar","Cordillera Cantbrica","Palabras Clave Aludes","riesgos","Geomorfologa","Montaa Cantbrica","Palabras Clave Periglaciar","Divisoria Cantbrica","Sierra De Cebolleda","len","ground penetrating radar (GPR)","ice cave","ice block","internal structure","Picos de Europa","cryomorphological topographies","ice caves","terrestrial laser scanner","periglacial cartography","coastal geomorphology","monitoring","morphology","geomatic techniques","sandy systems","shoreline change","coastal process","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","photogrammetry (SfM)","image format","image properties","mapping","change detection","geomorphology","permafrost","climate warming","Pyrenees","rock surface temperature","rock wall permafrost","temperature modeling","Vignemale peak","altitudinal distribution","high mountain","mountain permafrost","periglacial belts","Periglacial","Seasonally frozen ground","Little Ice Age","paraglacial processes","recent warming","Iberian Peninsula","Beaches","Cliffs","UAV"]},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"Sánchez-Fernández","affiliations":[],"email":"msf@unex.es","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["Laser scanning","Architectural survey","Conservation","Heritage","Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM)","cryomorphological topographies","ice caves","terrestrial laser scanner","periglacial cartography","Picos de Europa","coastal geomorphology","monitoring","morphology","geomatic techniques","sandy systems","livestock watering pond","volume–area relationship","structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM)","LIDAR","terrestrial laser scanner (TLS)","global navigation satellite system (GNSS)","Cultural heritage","3D model","spectral signature","quarry","rock glacier","glacier modelling","glacier evolution","morphogenic dynamic","shoreline change","coastal process","unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)","photogrammetry (SfM)","image format","image properties","mapping","change detection","geomorphology","permafrost","road infrastructures","Natura 2000 network","protected natural areas","environmental management","landscape fragmentation metrics","landscape unit","sandy beaches","breakwater","erosion","nourishment","aerial photogrammetry","TLS","construction and demolition waste (CDW)","remote sensing","DEM","RVT","photointerpretation","geomatics","GNSS","UAV","Pyrenees","una","entornos rurales","autovías","discurren inevitablemente","por","cómo pueden","Check dam","Structure from Motion photogrammetry (SfM)","small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS)","Digital Elevation Model","Sediment volume","UAV plus SfM","gully erosion","headcuts","valley bottoms","overgrazing","Southwest Spain","Soil erosion","Rangelands","Terrestrial laser scanning","Partially exposed roots","Basal growth"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":58,"location":null,"raw_text":"Gómez-Lende, M.; Sánchez-Fernández, M.
