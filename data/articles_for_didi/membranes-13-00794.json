It is demonstrated how the benefits and sustainability attributes of hydrogen systems can be observed using thermodynamics, life cycle assessment and other methods, and that hydrogen fuel cell systems can play a significant role, particularly by facilitating the use of renewable energy and by increasing efficiency. The usefulness of exergy methods for enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of hydrogen energy systems is also described. The importance of hydrogen energy and fuel cell systems in mitigating environmental impacts, including climate change, is highlighted throughout. Two illustrations are presented, one covering an efficiency assessment of a PEM fuel cell, and the other a life cycle assessment of fuel cell vehicles. The largest energy consumption for an internal combustion engine vehicle is in the usage stage. Energy consumption for PEM fuel cell vehicles in use is several times smaller. On a life cycle basis, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of the PEM fuel cell are less than half those for the internal combustion engine vehicle. These results can vary depending on the source of hydrogen. The results are expected to be useful to scientists, researchers and engineers as well as policy and decision makers.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.esd.2011.03.006","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Ibrahim","last_name":"Dincer","affiliations":[],"email":"ibrahim.dincer@uoit.ca","orcid":"","h_index":95,"keywords":["Tube

In recent years, step-wise reforming of hydrocarbons has been proposed for production of CO-free hydrogen for fuel cell applications. The decomposition of hydrocarbons (first step of the step-wise reforming process) has been extensively investigated. Both steam and air have been employed for catalyst regeneration in the second step of the process. Since, PEM is poisoned by very low (ppm) levels of CO, it is essential to eliminate even trace amounts of CO from the reformate stream. Preferential oxidation of CO (PROX) is considered to be a promising method for trace CO clean up. Related studies along with a discussion of catalytic ammonia decomposition (for applications in alkaline fuel cells) will be included in this review.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/s0920-5861(02)00233-x","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tushar V.","last_name":"Choudhary","affiliations":[],"email":"tushar.v.choudhary@conocophillips.com","orcid":"","h_index":30,"keywords":["zeolite","MFI","methane activation","Galloaluminosilicate","alkenes","aromatics","alkanes","ZSM","great","Pulse reaction of methane","Methane combustion","Pd0/Al2O3","PdO/Al2O3","Partially reduced PdO/Al2O3","Partially oxidized Pd0/Al2O3","Oxidation","optimization","Heavy Oil Desulfurization","hydrotreaters","Structure","sorption/diffusion","penetration","conformations","sorbate","configuration","model","benzene","compressibility","Inelastic","neutron","species","propylene","Scattering","epoxidation","Au/TiO2","H2O2","INS","hydrogen production","methane","carbon black","value added","surface science","natural gas","heterogeneous catalysis","nickel","reaction mechanisms","ruthenium","surface analysis","fuels","partial oxidation","syngas","arenes","cyclizations","ethane","zeolites","Inhibition","Aromatic hydrogenation","Nitrogen","Hydrodesulfurization","naphthalene","NiMo","tetralin","aromatic compounds","hydrogenation","phenanthrene","feed","Propane aromatization","Ga-based zeolites","Aromatic distribution","Acidity","Hydrothermal treatment and steam","Oxy-CO2 reforming","Propane aromatisation","Space velocity","ZSM-5","Selectivity","Aromatization of natural gas","H-Galloaluminosilicate (MFI)","H-Gallosilicate (MFI)","Steam reforming","Dry (CO2) reforming","Oxy-steam reforming","High-temperature stable","CO oxidation","PROX","stability","phosphine complex","Gold catalysis","Particle size","Nano-gold","Direct H2O2 synthesis","Halides","Promoter","Decomposition","Sulfur","Deactivation","Regeneration","High temperature stable","Aromatization","Si/Ga ratio","Si/Al ratio","Propane","Zeolitic factors","H2O2 decomposition","H2O2 synthesis","Pd catalysts","Acid","Pretreatment","nano gold","presence","propylene oxide","gasification","CO free hydrogen","Steam","Reforming","fuel","Stepwise","Nvs","Surface Intermediates","Ru Catalysts","crystal","HREELS","surface species","ammonia","CO","-free","co-adsorption","acetylene hydrogenation","Au catalysts","gold","Ni/SiO","fuel cells","Decomposition of Methane","Catalytic","ppm","stream","ammonia decomposition","fuel cell","hydrogen","catalysts","supported","activation energies","simultaneously","Conversion","GaAIMFI","GaAlMFI","higher alkanes","thermal pretreatment","sup","propane aromatization activity","desorption","Coadsorption","kJ/mol","temperature","sub","behavior","Analysemethoden","Brennstofftechnik","Entschwefelung","Grüne Chemie","Schwefel","Activation","Homologation","Model catalysts","Ni and Ru","Aromatization of propane","Aromatics distribution","H-GaAlMFI zeolite","Influence of temperature on product selectivity","Catalytic combustion","Lower alkanes","Noble metal catalysts","Metal-oxide catalysts","Perovskites","Hexaaluminates","CO-free hydrogen production","Step-wise reforming","Direct synthesis","Metal additives","Oxidation state","Supports","Bio-fuels","Deoxygenation","Renewables","Pyrolysis oils","Triglycerides","HDN","HDS","Kinetics","Catalyst","Hydrotreating","Heavy oil","heavy oils","extremely","sulfur removal","unraveled","desulfurization","analytical methods","fuel technology","green chemistry"]},{"first_name":"D.

In this paper, SSC-CCM is prepared by the SSC-PFSA (Aquivion, EW 720) ionomer, and the comparative sample (LSC-CCM) is based on the LSC-PFSA ionomer (Nafion, EW 1100). Compared with LSC-CCM, SSC-CCM shows higher porosity, larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and smaller high-frequency resistance. Polarization curves of SSC-CCM tested by the short stack show better performance than those of LSC-CCM, especially under the lower relative humidity operations. Moreover, the SSC-CCM outputs higher voltage and is more stable in the dynamic process with temperature continuously increasing under lower relative humidity operation. Such excellent performance of SSC-CCM is confirmed from the higher proton conductivity of SSC-PFSA under low relative humidity. These results indicate that the SSC-PFSA ionomer could be employed for the CCM catalyst layer under the operation conditions of low relative humidity and dynamic running for automotive applications.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.0c02110","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jiabin","last_name":"Shen","affiliations":[],"email":"shenjb@scu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":23,"keywords":["Multistage stretching extrusion","CNT","Electrical Resistivity","Carbon Black","Flow Direction","Percolation Threshold","Conductive Network","Interfacial slip","Multilayer","Morphology","blend","epoxy","poly (butylene terephthalate) (PBT)","poly (ethylene–octene) (POE)","toughening","flammability","extrusion","conductive polymer composites","electrical properties","interface","microwave absorption","multilayered structure","Thermoplastic polyurethane","Carbon nanotubes","Intumescent flame retardants","EMI shielding property","Flame retardancy","isotactic polypropylene (iPP)","polyamide 6 (PA6)","in situ microfibrillar reinforced composite (MFC)","morphological development","A.

The impact of solvent/dispersion media was probed by preparing films from two different types of Nafion dispersionsIPA-diluted dispersion and Nafion-in-water dispersion. The thickness of films was ascertained by three different techniques: variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The three techniques yielded consistent nominal thicknesses of 4, 10, 30, 55, 75, 110, 160, and 300 nm for films self-assembled from IPA-diluted Nafion dispersions of concentrations 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 wt %, respectively. Films generated from 0.255.0 wt % Nafion-in-water dispersions generated comparable thicknesses. An interesting finding of our work is the observation of bimodal surface wettability, investigated by water contact angle. The sub-55 nm films were found to exhibit hydrophilic surface whereas the thicker films showed hydrophobic surface similar to those reported for Nafion membranes. Employing XDLVO theory, surface energies of the hydrophobic, 160 nm film was found to be similar to that reported for Nafion membrane whereas those for the hydrophilic 4 nm film yielded high electron-accepting/proton-donating parameters resulting in an enhanced surface polarity. It can be concluded that the structure and properties of the ultrathin (<55 nm) Nafion films are distinct from those of the thicker (but still submicrometer) films, which are likely similar to those of the well-studied Nafion membranes. No significant effect of dispersion type was observed for 10300 nm thick films.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/ma4002319","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Kunal","last_name":"Karan","affiliations":[],"email":"kkaran@ucalgary.ca","orcid":"","h_index":43,"keywords":["Direct

In this paper, the properties of Nafion, a prototypical ionomer, are investigated as thin films (4 to 300 nm) on carbon, gold, and platinum substrates that are fabricated using different casting methods and thermal histories. Specifically, water uptake, swelling, and morphology are investigated by quartz-crystal microbalance, ellipsometry, and grazing-incidence X-ray scattering to develop structure/property/ processing relationships. For all substrates, as the films' thickness decreased, there is an initial decrease in swelling followed by a subsequent increase for film thicknesses below approximate to 20 nm due to a disordering of the film hydrophilic/hydrophobic structure. Decreased swelling and less structural order is observed on gold for spin-cast films compared to self-assembled films; the opposite effect is observed for films on carbon. The presented systematic data set and analyses represent a thorough study of the behavior of Nafion thin films on model substrates of interest in metal catalyst/carbon electrodes, and these insights help to elucidate the underlying polymer physics and confinement effects in these and related systems.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1002/adfm.201304311","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Ahmet","last_name":"Kusoglu","affiliations":[],"email":"akusoglu@lbl.gov","orcid":"","h_index":36,"keywords":["Fuel

Three different PFSA side chain fragments were considered with a CF3CFCF3 backbone representation: Nafion (OCF2CF(CF3)O(CF2)2SO3H), Aquivion or the short side chain (SSC) (O(CF2)2SO3H), and the 3M PFSA (O(CF2)4SO3H). Rotational potential energy surfaces for each bond along the length of the side chains were obtained using density functional theory with the B3LYP and the dispersion-corrected B97D functionals with and without the inclusion of a solvation model. Solvent effects were found to have minimal effect on bond rotations close to the tetrafluoroethylene backbone but had greater impact near the terminal sulfonic acid group. The carbonsulfur bond was found to be the most flexible portion of the side chain in each of the fragments which was further enhanced with the inclusion of the solvent. Complete rotation about either the OCF2 or CFO bond in the Nafion side chain resulted in fairly high energetic barriers, but significant portions of these rotational surfaces had energetic penalties less than 1.5 kcal/mol indicating substantial conformational freedom. Fully extended and folded conformations of the Nafion side chain exhibit considerable contraction in side chain end-to-end distance and were observed to be nearly isoenergetic using B3LYP, but the folded structures with the ether oxygen atoms in gauche conformations were 1.5 kcal/mol lower in energy using B97D. Below the second ether linkage of the Nafion side chain, the rotational potential energy profiles were identical to that determined for the SSC side chain. The 3M side chain was generally found to be the most rigid with barriers for complete rotation about the central carboncarbon bonds of approximately 7 kcal/mol. These results indicate that minor differences in side chain length and chemistry may have a pronounced effect on the rotational potential energy surfaces, particularly those involving rotation about different carboncarbon bonds with distinctly different character.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/jp407568d","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Stephen

This study presents an electrochemical based analysis of using long-side-chain Nafion® and short-side-chain Aquivion® PFSA ionomers as binders in the catalyst-layers of PEMFC. Membrane electrode assemblies were designed with consistent components, varying only the catalyst ink's ionomer type from 28 wt% Aquivion® to 28 wt% Nafion®. The durability and performance profile of the resulting catalyst-coated-membranes made from using these PFSA ionomers as binders in the catalyst layers was investigated. Semi-empirical modeling shows that the Nafion® ionomer based binders give a catalyst-coated-membrane with a 46.6% higher ohmic resistance compared to using Aquivion® ionomers as binders. The power density analysis also showed that catalyst-coated-membranes made with Aquivion® ionomer based binder gives an output power that is 22.33% higher than catalyst-coated-membranes made with Nafion® ionomers as binders in the catalyst layers. The Aquivion® ionomer binder also shows higher catalyst utilization compared to the Nafion® ionomer binders. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Equivalent Circuit Model analysis showed that the membrane electrode assembly degradation is more pronounced in the Nafion® ionomer based binder compared to its Aquivion® counterpart. It is thus shown that Aquivion® ionomers are better catalyst binders compared to the Nafion® ionomers as they result in catalyst-coated-membranes that are better performing and more durable.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2019.10.079","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Emmanuel O.","last_name":"Balogun","affiliations":[],"email":"blgemm001@myuct.ac.za","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["PFSA ionomers","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","Accelerated stress testing","Catalyst coated membranes","Polarization","Power curve"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":22,"location":null,"raw_text":"Balogun, E.O.; Hussain, N.; Chamier, J.; Barendse, P.

However, at this level of cathode Pt loading, large performance loss is observed at high-current density (>1 A/cm2), preventing a reduction in the overall stack cost. This next developmental step is being limited by the presence of a resistance term exhibited at these lower Pt loadings and apparently due to a phenomenon at or near the catalyst surface. This issue can be addressed through the design of catalysts with high and stable Pt dispersion as well as through development and implementation of ionomers designed to interact with Pt in a way that does not constrain oxygen reduction reaction rates. Extrapolating from progress made in past decades, we are optimistic that the concerted efforts of materials and electrode designers can resolve this issue, thus enabling a large step toward fuel cell

The origin of this resistance remains unclear. Minimization of CL mass-transport resistance is imperative to achieve better CL design and performance. In this paper, an operando method based on H2 limiting current is used to characterize and quantify CL resistance in traditional porous Pt/carbon-based electrodes. CL sub-resistances are isolated using continuum multiscale modeling and experiments, investigating the effects of reactant molecular weight, pressure, and ionomer to carbon weight ratio. The results expose CL resistance including both interfacial and transport components, although the majority of the CL resistance is ascribed to a local resistance close to the Pt reaction sites, which includes interfacial resistance and local transport resistance. Variations in temperature, humidity, and primary particle loading (Pt:C ratio) highlight the impact of operating conditions and CL design parameters on CL sub-resistances. The observed trends guide optimization of CL design to achieve novel low-loaded fuel-cell electrodes.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1149/2.0031907jes","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"Schuler","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":12,"keywords":["Evolution","particle

Therein, the storage of catalyst ink is a neglected but crucial topic. Undoubtedly, a structurally stable catalyst ink is more resistant to storage and suitable for commercialization. In this work, the structural stability of catalyst inks containing short-side-chain (SSC) ionomer and long-side-chain (LSC) ionomer after storage and their effects on the catalyst layer (CL) microstructure and the cell performance are investigated. The result demonstrates that the catalyst ink with LSC ionomer has better structural stability than the catalyst ink with SSC ionomer. The adsorbed ionomers on Pt/C in SSC ionomer catalyst ink increase after ink storage, resulting in increased ionomer coverage and deteriorated ionomer distribution in the CL, which makes the cell subject to higher mass transport resistance. As a result, the LSC ionomer catalyst ink after storage can achieve the initial ink properties after redispersion, while the SSC ionomer catalyst ink fails. Therefore, to promote the practical application of SSC ionomer, the ink storage should be considered.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2021.230698","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Zhigang","last_name":"Shao","affiliations":[],"email":"zhgshao@dicp.ac.cn","orcid":"","h_index":46,"keywords":["Photoelectrochemical

Four combinations of the MEAs composed of short-side-chain (SSC) and long-side-chain (LSC) perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) polymers as membrane and ionomer materials have been prepared and tested under various temperatures and humidity conditions, aiming to investigate the effects of different side chain polymer in membranes and CLs on fuel cell performance. It is discovered that SSC PFSA polymer used as membrane and ionomer in CL yields better fuel cell performance than LSC PFSA polymer, especially at high temperature and low RH conditions. The MEA with the SSC PFSA employed both as a membrane and as an ionomer in cathode CL demonstrates the best cell performance amongst the investigated MEAs. Furthermore, various electrochemical diagnoses have been applied to fundamentally understand the contributions of the different resistances to the overall cell performance. It is illustrated that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) made the greatest contribution to the overall cell resistance and then membrane resistance (Rm), implying that the use of the advanced ionomer in CL could lead to more noticeable improvement in cell performance than only the substitution as the membrane.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/ma15010078","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nana","last_name":"Zhao","affiliations":[],"email":"nana.zhao@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["Membranes","Proton exchange membrane fuel cells","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","Manufacturing","Charge transfer","Durability","Fuel cell technology","Fuel cells","Transportation systems","sulfonated","resistances","Hydrophilic Domains","Membranes Liquid","vapor","Water Transport Resistance","SPEEK","proton exchange","carboxymethyl starch","dewatering","flocculants","oil sand tailings","settling rate","anion exchange membrane","CO2 electrolysis","stability","permselectivity","Aemion","Fuel cell","Cathode","Defect","Performance","Proton exchange membrane (PEM)","Additives","Iron contamination","Degradation","membrane","vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs)","ex-situ evaluation","vanadium ion crossover","chemical stability","proton conductivity","ionomer","long side chain","perfluorosulfonic acid","PEM fuel cell","short side chain","proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell","1, 2, 4-triazole","contamination","conditioning","melt blowing processing","starch","water treatment","charge properties","atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)"]},{"first_name":"Zhiqing","last_name":"Shi","affiliations":[],"email":"zhiqing.shi@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["carboxymethyl starch","dewatering","flocculants","oil sand tailings","settling rate","Membrane additive","Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)","Conditioning","Durability","Migration","proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell","1, 2, 4-triazole","additives","contamination","melt blowing processing","anolyte","carbonate ion crossover","membranes","sup","Gap","KOH","electrochemical reduction","made","AEMs","sub","devices","anion exchange","exchange membranes","anion exchange membrane","CO2 electrolysis","stability","permselectivity","Aemion","Fuel cell","Cathode","Defect","Performance","Manufacturing","Proton exchange membrane (PEM)","Iron contamination","Degradation","Ion exchange membranes","Electrochemical CO2 reduction","Membrane-based CO2 electrolyzer","Carbon capture and utilization","membrane","vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs)","ex-situ evaluation","vanadium ion crossover","chemical stability","proton conductivity","ionomer","long side chain","perfluorosulfonic acid","PEM fuel cell","short side chain","starch","water treatment","charge properties","atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)","Operating Conditions","Open‐Circuit Voltage","Proton Exchange Membrane"]},{"first_name":"Francois","last_name":"Girard","affiliations":[],"email":"francois.girard@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell","1, 2, 4-triazole","additives","contamination","conditioning","melt blowing processing","ionomer","long side chain","membrane","perfluorosulfonic acid","PEM fuel cell","short side chain"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":26,"location":null,"raw_text":"Zhao, N.; Shi, Z.; Girard, F.

However, the electrodes based on these two prominent ionomers have not been sufficiently investigated under sub-freezing conditions. In this study, the impact of ionomer type on the degradations of the surface wettability and gas permeability characteristics has been investigated for PEM fuel cell electrodes under freeze-thaw (F-T) cycles between 30 °C and 40 °C. The electrodes comprised of either SSC or LSC ionomers are manufactured with different catalyst loadings. It is found that the F-T cycles induce severe degradations in the electrodes, and the resulting surface morphologies differ greatly, depending on the ionomer type and catalyst loading. For a given catalyst loading, the SSC electrodes degrade more heavily than the LSC ones. Further, independent of the ionomer type, the high catalyst loading electrodes tend to degrade slower than their low catalyst loading counterparts. The SSC catalyst layers peel off from the electrodes virtually completely with the microporous layer largely degraded, inducing a highly corroded and heterogeneous surface morphology. The LSC electrodes experience relatively less degradations, thus the resulting surface morphologies are less corroded and more homogeneous. For all the electrodes, the morphological degradations cause a substantial increase in the gas permeability coefficients, but a decrease in the static contact angles. These increments and decrements correlate well with the severity of the surface degradations, and they are rapid and more substantial for the SSC electrodes.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2018.11.184","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Adnan","last_name":"Ozden","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["Direct

The results were compared with those for a baseline CCL containing 30 wt% of the conventional ionomer 1100 EW Nafion®. The CCLs fabricated with 1020 wt% of the Aquivion™ ionomer displayed a similar morphology to the Nafion®-based CCLs. Electrochemical surface areas (ECSA) and double layer capacitances of all the Aquivion™-based samples were similar to those of the baseline. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics in CCLs with 20 wt% and 30 wt% Aquivion™ were lower than the baseline under 100% relative humidity (RH), yet similar to the baseline at 70% RH. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements suggested that the lowered ORR kinetics at 100% RH may be attributed to the large mass transport resistance in Aquivion™-based samples at low current densities. Relative to the baseline, CCLs containing 20 wt% Aquivion™ ionomer demonstrated an improvement in fuel cell performance under operating conditions of 95 °C and RH values of 30, 50 and 70%. The greater hydrophilicity of the SSC ionomers is believed to account for the improved fuel cell performance at the relatively higher operating temperature and dry conditions.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.03.024","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Dmitri","last_name":"Bessarabov","affiliations":[],"email":"dmitri.bessarabov@nwu.ac.za","orcid":"","h_index":38,"keywords":["Sustainable

In this work, we compare performance and durability between long side chain (LSC) and short side chain (SSC) PFSA ionomers as a solid electrolyte membrane and as ionomer-additive in the electrodes. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are prepared combining the LSC/SSC membrane with the corresponding LSC/SSC ionomer in the catalyst layer. Thereby, their chemical compatibility could be determined. MEAs are tested in single cell test benches with segmented bipolar plate for long term degradation test with dynamic load-cycling. While maintaining uniform conditions, we have experienced that different MEAs show different behavior in short-term to long-term application. Owing to its stability in lower equivalent weight; SSC ionomer provides favorable proton conductivity leading to higher power density of the cell. Nevertheless, faster degradation of SSC than the LSC ionomer are encountered in this study likely due to the higher gas permeation of thinner SSC membranes and lower polytetrafluoroethylene content. This study contributes a significant insight in the behavior of ionomers in FC as function of time, and shows avenues for further improvement of durability.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2019.227078","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Krishan","last_name":"Talukdar","affiliations":[],"email":"krishan.talukdar@dlr.de","orcid":"","h_index":9,"keywords":["thermal","sup","electrolyte

Five types of solution-cast membranes were produced from commercial perfluorinated ionomers (3M and Aquivion (AQ)) with different equivalent weights, annealed at different temperatures, and characterized in terms of ion conductivity, water uptake, and in-plane/through-plane swelling, while the effect of annealing on physical structure of membranes was evaluated by small-angle X-ray scattering and dynamic mechanical analysis. To create a reinforced composite membrane (RCM), we impregnated a polytetrafluoroethylene porous support with 3M 729 and AQ 720 electrolytes exhibiting excellent proton conductivity and water uptake. The electrolyte impregnation stability for the porous support was evaluated using a solvent resistance test, and the best performance was observed for the 3M 729 RCM annealed at 200 °C. Both annealed and nonannealed 3M 729 RCMs were used to produce membrane electrode assemblies, the durability of which was evaluated by open-circuit voltage combined wetdry cycling tests. The nonannealed 3M 729 RCM survived 5800 cycles, while the 3M 729 RCM annealed at 200 °C survived 16 600 cycles and thus exhibited improved mechanical durability.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.9b02436","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Byungchan","last_name":"Bae","affiliations":[],"email":"bcbae@kier.re.kr","orcid":"","h_index":27,"keywords":["fuel

The distribution of ionomer plays an important role in the design of high-performance porous electrode catalyst layers since the transport of species, such as oxygen and protons, is controlled by the thickness of the ionomer on the catalyst surface and the continuity of the ionomer and gas networks in the catalyst layer, with the transport of electrons being related to the continuity of the carbon particle network. In this study, the effect of solvents in ionomer dispersions on the performance and durability of catalyst layers (CLs) is investigated. Five different types of catalyst inks were used: (i) ionomer dispersed in NMP; (ii) ionomer dispersed in waterIPA; (iii) ionomer dispersed in NMP, followed by adding waterIPA; (iv) ionomer dispersed in waterIPA, followed by adding NMP; and (v) a mixture of ionomer dispersed in NMP and ionomer dispersed in waterIPA. Dynamic light scattering of the five dispersions showed different average particles sizes: ~0.40 μm for NMP, 0.911.75 μm for the mixture, and ~2.02 μm for waterIPA. The membrane-electrode assembly prepared from an ionomer dispersion with a larger particle size (i.e., waterIPA) showed better performance, while that prepared from a dispersion with a smaller particle size (i.e., NMP) showed better durability.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/en12030549","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Chan-Ho","last_name":"Song","affiliations":[],"email":"schanho0525@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["catalyst

The MEA parameters including gas diffusion layer, ionomer content, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) type, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and catalyst loading were optimized by calculating the round-trip efficiency of URFC. The performance in FC mode was largely affected by the MEA parameters compared to that of the WE mode performance. The FC mode performance is crucial for the achievement of high URFC performance. The optimized round-trip efficiency was 49% at 500 mA cm2, which is comparable or superior to that reported in literature. This result can be attributed to the highly efficient MEA structure suitable for bifunctional catalysts to participate in both ORR and

Considering Nafion as a model PFSA ionomer, herein, we report the details of its molecular assembly in various solvents (dielectric constant, εr = 2.38109) using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. In contrast to the long-held view of elongated aggregate structure of Nafion, our study shows that a variety of structures exist depending on solvent polarity. The work revealed the existence and clustering of ion pairs in Nafion dispersions, a phenomenon reported for the first time for PFSA ionomer dispersions. We introduce a new aggregation phase diagram for Nafion in different solvents: (a) type-I aggregate: aggregates with ionomer chains physically cross-linked via ionic clusters in low dielectric solvents [toluene, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), ethanol, glycerol]; (b) type-II aggregate: lamella like two-dimensional (2D)-aggregates self-assembled via weak hydrophobic interactions in intermediate dielectric solvents (formic acid); and (c) type III aggregate: tightly packed elongated aggregates formed through strong hydrophobic interactions in high dielectric solvents (water, formamide). Further, our fully atomistic simulations highlight the significant shortcomings of a prior coarse-grained approach wherein the solvent atoms are not explicitly modeled, resulting in an unrealistic aggregate structure in all solvents. With explicit consideration of the solvent molecules, we uncovered a new phenomenon of microphase segregation of solvents (isopropyl alcohol/water mixture) driven by PFSAs surfactant-like hydrophilic/hydrophobic character.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/acs.macromol.9b01663","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Kunal","last_name":"Karan","affiliations":[],"email":"kkaran@ucalgary.ca","orcid":"","h_index":43,"keywords":["Direct

Nowadays, graphene is considered one of the most promising candidates for improving the ionic transport properties, isotopic selectivity and proton conductivity throughout the unique two-dimensional structure. In this paper, we report on the development of graphene modified commercial membranes (Fumapem®) containing different graphene loadings for PEMWE applications. The membranes are characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and thermo-gravimetrical and differential thermal analysis (TGA-DSC). Properties of composite membranes are investigated, including water uptake and ion-exchange capacity (IEC). In plane four-electrode arrangement is used to determine the proton conductivity of the composite membranes. It is found that composite membranes show an improved behaviour when compared to pristine commercial membranes and graphene loading can improve proton conductivity. In our conditions, the calculated activation energy (Ea) for proton conduction is found to be about 3.80 kJ mol1 for the composite Fumapem®/graphene membrane with 10 mg graphene loading, lower than of the pristine polymer proton exchange

With well controlled contents of SDBS-GO, the composite membranes exhibit higher IEC, water uptake, and proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability than Nafion® 112, making them attractive as proton exchange membranes (PEMs).

Particularly, the interaction of perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) ionomer with the carbon supported platinum catalyst plays a critical role in controlling reactant transport to the active site. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the side chain length and equivalent weight (EW) of PFSA ionomers on the CCL transport resistances. Ex situ measurements were carried out to quantify the ionomer characteristics such as the molecular weight, proton conductivity and water uptake. Nanomorphology of ionomers cast as 60120 nm thin-films is characterized using grazing-incidence X-ray scattering. In situ fuel cell electrochemical diagnostic measurements were carried out to quantify the reactant (H+/O2) transport properties of the CCL. Ionomer EW was found to play a major role with decreasing EW yielding higher proton conductivity and water uptake that led to lower bulk-H+ and local-O2 transport resistances in the CCL. Finally, a 1D-semi-empirical performance model has been developed to quantify the impact of ionomer EW on cell voltage loss factors.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1149/1945-7111/abe5eb","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Nagappan","last_name":"Ramaswamy","affiliations":[],"email":"nagappan.ramaswamy@gm.com","orcid":"","h_index":23,"keywords":["operant

For sub50 nm thin Nafion films, the thermal expansion coefficient of films decreased in the order of most hydrophobic to most hydrophilic substrate: OTS > graphene > SiO2 > Au > Pt, implying weaker interpolymer and polymersubstrate interactions for films on hydrophobic substrates. Expansion coefficient of films on SiO2, graphene, and OTSmodified SiO2 decreased with thickness whereas that of films on Au and Pt substrates increased with thickness. Above ~100 nm of thickness, films on all substrates converged toward a common value representative of bulk Nafion. Thermal transition temperature was found to be higher for films on hydrophilic SiO2 than that for films on hydrophobic graphene and OTSmodified SiO2 but was not discernible for films on Au and Pt substrates. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We attempt to understand this effect by comparing PEMFCs with cathode CLs containing Pt on carbon-black (CB) and either SSC Aquivion ionomer or a standard long-side-chain (LSC) Nafion ionomer at 50% and 100% RH. The CL microstructures are characterized for their micro- and mesoporosity. The CLs are formed into PEMFCs and probed with polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry, O2 gain, limiting current measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. PEMFCs containing the SSC ionomer in the cathode CL have superior polarization curves compared to those containing the LSC ionomer in the mass transport region under all conditions. We find that the SSC ionomer imparts lower proton transport resistances, lower charge transfer resistance to the cathode near 0.60 V, and lower mass transport resistance at 0.40 V. We attribute some of the performance improvements to the superior proton conductivity of the SSC ionomer, and the remainder to the higher micropore volume in the SSC-containing CLs which can more effectively evaporate water to the gas phase, improving both the availability of catalyst sites for charge transfer and mesopores for gas transport.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1149/2.1361805jes","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Yannick","last_name":"Garsany","affiliations":[],"email":"yannick.garsany.ctr.fr@nrl.navy.mil","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["PEMFCs","asymmetric &amp","symmetric GDM","Freudenberg","SGL 29BC","dead-ended anode (DEA) mode","ionomer","SSC","proton","cathode","containing CLs","chain","side","Pt and Pd","Anode","electrocatalysts","sub","layers","RDE","Pt/C","Pd/C","graded","Fuel cells","Membrane electrode assembly","Catalyst layer","Fabrication","Dual catalyst layer"]},{"first_name":"Robert Atkinson","last_name":"Iii","affiliations":[],"email":"robert.atkinson.ctr@nrl.navy.mil","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["PEMFCs","asymmetric &amp","symmetric GDM","Freudenberg","SGL 29BC","dead-ended anode (DEA) mode","ionomer","SSC","proton","cathode","containing CLs","chain","side","GDM","sup","Media","porosity","structural","behavior","fuel","cell","open","stress","GDM compression","resistances","fuel cell","ohmic resistance","production","Pt and Pd","Anode","electrocatalysts","sub","layers","RDE","Pt/C","Pd/C","graded","Fuel cells","Membrane electrode assembly","Catalyst layer","Fabrication","Dual catalyst layer","anode and cathode","asymmetric","GDM pairing","hydrogen","prognostic model","thermal gradient","lithium plating","battery degradation modes","isothermal","electrode","mA cm","cell behavior","safety","thermal gradients","Batteries","interelectrode thermal","Li ion","capacity"]},{"first_name":"Benjamin D.","last_name":"Gould","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":3,"keywords":["ionomer","SSC","proton","PEMFCs","cathode","containing CLs","chain","side","GDM","sup","Media","porosity","structural","behavior","fuel","cell","open","stress","GDM compression","resistances","fuel cell","ohmic resistance","production"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":44,"location":null,"raw_text":"Garsany, Y.; Atkinson, R.W.; Sassin, M.B.; Hjelm, R.M.; Gould, B.D.; Swider-Lyons, K.E.

On the basis of the results obtained with the model anions, the adsorption of the terminal sulfonate moieties in perfluorinated sulfonic acid ionomers and its effect on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is discussed.

But the commercialization of fuel cells has encountered difficulties due to the high-cost issue. The key to addressing the cost issue of PEMFCs lies in reducing Pt amount. However, concen-tration polarization in the high current density region increases as the decrease of Pt loading, of which the local transport loss of oxygen in the cathode catalyst layer (CCL) occupies the most significant part. Therefore, reducing local oxygen transport resistance is necessary to achieve ultra-low Pt loading in practical PEMFC. This paper focuses on sum-marizing various electrode design methods for the CCL that optimize the local transport resistance of oxygen, including modifications to the ionomer layer, catalyst structure, and overall electrode structure. Each improvement method is explained with the mechanism of the local oxygen transport process, investigating the effect of different ionomer and Pt -based nanoparticle structures, distribution, and surface chemistries on the local trans-port pathways. The insights proposed in this paper provide recommendations for the fabrication and design of high-efficiency low-platinum fuel cells.& COPY; 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Detailed experimental parameters are controlled and measured under widely varying operating conditions. In addition to polarization curves, feed gas flow rates, temperatures, pressure drop, and relative humidity are measured. Performance of fuel cells was studied using steady-state polarization curves, transient IV response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. Different feed gas humidity, operating temperature, feed gas stoichiometry, air pressure, fuel cell size and gas flow patterns were found to affect both the steady state and dynamic response of the fuel cells. It was found that the humidity of cathode inlet gas had a significant effect on fuel cell performance. The experimental results showed that a decrease in the cathode humidity has a detrimental effect on fuel cell steady state and dynamic performance. Temperature was also found to have a significant effect on the fuel cell performance through its effect on membrane conductivity and water transport in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and catalyst layer. The polarization curves of the fuel cell at different operating temperatures showed that fuel cell performance was improved with increasing temperature from 65 to 75 °C. The air stoichiometric flow rate also influenced the performance of the fuel cell directly by supplying oxygen and indirectly by influencing the humidity of the membrane and water flooding in cathode side. The fuel cell steady state and dynamic performance also improved as the operating pressure was increased from 1 to 4 atm. Based on the experimental results, both the steady state and dynamic response of the fuel cells (stack) were analyzed. These experimental data will provide a baseline for validation of fuel cell models.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.03.077","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Qiangu","last_name":"Yan","affiliations":[],"email":"yan@cavs.msstate.edu","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["PEMFCs","Performance","Transient response","Various conditions","PEM fuel cell","Water transport","Nafion membrane","Electro-osmotic drag","Net electro-osmotic drag","Water back diffusion flux","Sub-freezing","Start-up","MEA","Degradation","SEM","Synthesis gas","Catalytic","Gas to liquids","Gasoline"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":48,"location":null,"raw_text":"Yan, Q.; Toghiani, H.; Causey, H.

Some of the experiments were conducted with low humidified reactants (relative humidity of 12%). The FC characterizations tests have been conducted using in situ electrochemical methods based on load current and cell voltage signal analysis, namely: polarization curves, EIS measurements, cyclic and linear sweep voltammetries (CV and LSV). The impacts of the parameters on the global FC performances were observed using the polarization curves whereas EIS, CV and LSV test results were used to discriminate the different voltage loss sources. The test results suggest that some parameter sets allow maximal output voltages but can also induce material degradation. For instance, higher FC temperature and air flow values can induce significant electrical efficiency benefits, notably by increasing the reversible potential and the reaction kinetics. However, raising the cell temperature can also gradually dry the FC and increase the risk of membrane failure. LSV has also shown that elevated FC temperature and relative humidity can also accelerate the electrolyte degradation (i.e. slightly higher fuel crossover rate) and reduce the lifetime
