The present work investigated the impact of different TiO2 NPs forms (rutile and anatase) on germination, growth, cell cycle profile, ploidy level, and micronucleus formation in Lactuca sativa (lettuce) and Ocimum basilicum (basil). Seeds were exposed to anatase (ana) or rutile + anatase (rut+ana) at concentrations 5 - 150 mg dm-3 for 5 d and after that different parameters were analyzed. Rut+ana showed high potential to impair germination and growth. On the other hand, ana alone showed a positive influence on seedling growth. Despite that, ana induced severe alterations in cell cycle dynamics. Regarding species, basil was more sensitive to TiO2 NPs cytostatic effects (delay/arrest in G0/G1 phase), whereas in lettuce TiO2 NPs were more genotoxic (micronucleus formation increase). Finally, we propose that, besides germination and plant growth, cell cycle dynamics and micronucleus formation can be sensitive biomarkers of these NPs.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s10535-017-0733-8","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Sónia","last_name":"Silva","affiliations":[],"email":"soniasilva@ua.pt","orcid":"","h_index":19,"keywords":["Metal toxicity mitigation","Nanoagriculture","Physiological endpoints","Titanium nanoparticles","somatic embryogenesis","seed germination","embryos","sterilization","light microscopy","electron microscopy","Secale cereale L.","Aluminium","Cell cycle","Root histology","Nutrient imbalances","Callose","Rye","Aluminum tolerance","Al toxicity","Root anatomy","Triticum aestivum L.

Ameliorating the salt-resistance of plants especially the crops is the most effective measure to solve the worldwide problem. The salinity can cause damage to plants mainly from two aspects: hyperosmotic and hyperionic stresses leading to the restrain of growth and photosynthesis. To the adverse effects, the plants derive corresponding strategies including: ion regulation and compartmentalization, biosynthesis of compatible solutes, induction of antioxidant enzymes and plant hormones. With the development of molecular biology, our understanding of the molecular and physiology knowledge is becoming clearness. The complex signal transduction underlying the salt resistance is being illuminated brighter and clearer. The SOS pathway is the central of the cell signaling in salt stress. The accumulation of the compatible solutes and the activation of the antioxidant system are the effective measures for plants to enhance the salt resistance. How to make full use of our understanding to improve the output of crops is a huge challenge for us, yet the application of the genetic engineering makes this possible. In this review, we will discuss the influence of the salt stress and the response of the plants in detail expecting to provide a particular account for the plant resistance in molecular, physiological and transgenic fields.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3109/07388551.2014.889080","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Xingmin","last_name":"Mu","affiliations":[],"email":"xmmu@ms.iswc.ac.cn","orcid":"","h_index":27,"keywords":["Sediment","Surface

G5 was highly affected by NaCl: at 65 and 130 mM plants were 48.6% and 59.1% shortened compared with to control. The volatiles compositions was also analyzed. Glucosinolates increased under 65 mM, then decreased at 130 mM. In G1, glucosinolates start with 7.4 (control), raised to 21.50 (65 mM) and finally dropped to 4.34 (130 mM).

Hence, diagnosing soil salinity is the first step towards appropriate management. The current work aims to assess and map soil salinity in the eastern Nile Delta using principal component analysis (PCA). In order to develop appropriate solutions for rational management to mitigate the impacts of soil salinization and increase yield production 34 soil profiles were dug that covered the variation in the soils located at the northeast of the Nile delta. The spatial variation of soil parameters was mapped using ordinary kriging interpolation. The results of PCA illustrated that, among the studied soil properties, soil electrical conductivity (ECe), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), exchangeable sodium percent (ESP), and bulk density (BD), are the critical factors affecting management practices in the Nile Delta. Two spatial management zones (SMZ) were identified; SMZ 1 occupied 45.04% of the study area and SMZ2 occupied 54.96% of the study area. The average of soil pH, ECe, SAR, CEC, ESP and BD were 8.31, 20.32 dSm1, 47.19, 32.9 cmolckg1, 32.85% and 1.47 Mgm3 for the first cluster (SMZ1), respectively. In addition, the second cluster (SMZ2) had average soil pH, ECe, SAR, CEC, ESP and BD of 7.75, 12.30 dSm1, 26.6, 25.23 cmolckg1, 26.6% and 1.27 Mgm3. The results showed p-value < 0.05 which confirms that there is a significant statistical difference between the two zones. Finally, the results obtained could be used as a fundamental basis for improving agricultural management practices in such salt-affected soils.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy11122510","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Samah M.

We studied the effects of short-term (6, 12, and 24 h) silicon (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM) application on salinity (NaCl)-induced phytohormonal [abscisic acid (ABA), jasmonic acid (JA), and salicylic acid (SA)] and antioxidant regulation in Oryza sativa. The results showed that Si treatments significantly increased rice plant growth compared to controls under salinity stress. Si treatments reduced the sodium accumulation resulting in low electrolytic leakage and lipid peroxidation compared to control plants under salinity stress. Enzymatic antioxidant (catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase) responses were more pronounced in control plants than in Si-treated plants under salinity stress. Stress- and defense-related phytohormones like JA were significantly downregulated and SA was irregular after short-term Si applications under salinity stress compared to control. Conversely, ABA was significantly higher after 6 and 12 h but insignificant after 24 h in Si-treated plants under salinity stress. After 6 and 12 h, Si and salinity stress resulted in upregulation of zeaxanthin epoxidase and 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase 1 and 4 (NCED1 and 4), whereas 24-h treatments significantly downregulated the expressions of these genes compared to those in the control. NCED3 expression increased after 6 and 24 h but it was insignificant after 12 h of Si application compared to control. The current findings indicate that increasing the Si concentrations for longer periods of time can regulate the salinity-induced stress by modulating phytohormonal and enzymatic antioxidants responses.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s00344-013-9356-2","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Abdul Latif","last_name":"Khan","affiliations":[],"email":"latifepm78@yahoo.co.uk","orcid":"","h_index":66,"keywords":["alkaloids","structure (organic substances)","enzyme inhibiting activity","Endemic Boswellia sacra","Genetic diversity","SDS PAGE","RAPD markers","Oman","Acridocarpus orientalis","Anticancer","Enzyme inhibition","Allelopathy","Antifungal","Anti-lipid peroxidation","and Antioxidant","Auxin","influx carrier","efflux carrier","AUX/LAX","PIN","ABCB","PILS","transmembrane domain","Stem rot","endophytic association","fungal pathogen","biological control","sunflower","weed control","Weed Occurrence","Aspect of Weed","Rice Field","Methods","Keywords Teucrium Muscatense","flavonoids","GC/MS","Anti-cancer","biological activities","terpenes","biochemistry","review","enzymes","anticarcinogenic activity","anticancer activity","pharmacology","medicinal chemistry","vaccines","serums","Nepeta floccosa","Floccosic acid","Metabolites","Cleome droserifolia","Indole alkaloids","Ochradenus arabicus","Cyclopropyl triterpenoid","Plastome","Ziziphus","SSRs","Inverted repeats","Phylogeny","Genome comparison","crude extracts","Geranium","wallichianum","urease","rhizomes","constituents","leaves","Proximate parameters","Essential oils","Omani medicinal plants","GC-MS","fungal","Gibberellin","ng/mL","growth promoting","GA production","strain","soil","Prohexadione-calcium","Chinese cabbage","Growth","Yield","Gibberellin biosynthesis","contamination","stress","RSC","metals","inoculation","inoculated plants","Cd treatments","phytoextraction","toxicity","PGPR","Plant growth promotion","Gibberellins","Cold stress","Hormonal modulation","biomedical research","bioinformatics","Antioxidants","Drought","Hormones","Pseudomonas","Salt","Soybean","Cd-hyperaccumulator","Endophytic fungi","Phytoremediation","Solanum nigrum","growth promotion","biocontrol","jasmonic acid","salicylic acid","Genomics","Phylogenetic analysis","Chloroplast genome","Chloroplasts","Genome analysis","Sequence alignment","Flowering plants","Plant genomics","Salinity","Avicennia marina","plant microbe interaction","endophyte","methionine","Rhizosphere","Bacteria","Microbiome","Cellulases","Species diversity","Fungal structure","Microbial ecology","Trees","Natural pigments","Antibacterial","Antileishmania","Antioxidant","Arthrobacter gandavensis","yellow pigment","pharmacological activities","HPLC","FTIR","Comparative genomics","Introns","Microsatellite loci","Phylogenetics","Transfer RNA","Pharmacy","Pharmacy, other","Nepeta clarkei","Nepethalate","Analgesic activity","Anti-inflammatory activity","Neuropharmacological activity","Abiotic stresses","crop growth and physiology","abscisic acid","gibberellic acid","salinity stress","Antifungal activity","EDX","elemental analysis","Penicillium funiculosum","Plant growth","Salt stress","Isoflavones","Gibberellin synthesis","Phytohormones","Burkholderia sp.","Cucumber","Mineral content","Prohexadione Calcium","Daminozide","Chrysanthemum morifolium","Neosartorya sp.","Endophytic fungus","Aspergillus fumigatus","Phoma sp.","Metarhizium anisopliae","Oxidative stress","Paecilomyces formosus LHL10","Thermotolerance","Cucumber plant growth","Abscisic acid and salicylic acid","Fatty acids and antioxidants","Silicon","Ethylene","Wounding stress","Rice","Chrysosporium pseudomerdarium","gibberellin production","plant growth-promotion","Solanum lycopersicum","Promicromonospora sp.

The plants were subjected to four different treatments: (1) nutrient solution alone (C), (2) nutrient solution + 40 mmol l1 NaCl (NaCl), (3) nutrient solution + 40 mmol l1 NaCl + 0.5 mmol l1 CaSiO3 (NaCl + Si1) and (4) nutrient solution + 40 mmol l1 NaCl+1 mmol l1 CaSiO3 (NaCl + Si2). The results showed that, in both species, salinity reduced all growth variables but silicate supplementation however partly overcame this growth reduction. Addition of silicate in NaClstressed plants maintained membrane permeability. Net photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance and transpiration were higher in plants under control treatment, and the inclusion of silicate in the nutrient solution resulted in a slight increase in these plant parameters. Intercellular CO2 was slightly higher in plants under silicate treatment than in plants under control or NaCl treatment. Calcium concentration in shoots and roots in both species was slightly higher in the treatments where silicate was added. Potassium concentration for salt treatment was reduced in shoot and root of both species in the absence of silicate. Sodium and chloride concentration in shoots and roots in both species were slightly higher in the presence of NaCl and were slightly reduced in the plants under silicate treatments. The results suggest that, in hydroponically grown plants, the inclusion of silicate in the nutrient solution is beneficial because it improves growth, physiological parameters and may contribute to a more balanced nutrition by enhancing nutrient uptake under NaClstressed conditions. Added calcium silicate may ameliorate the parameters affected by high salinity, may reduce sodium and chloride, and can slightly increase calcium and potassium concentrations in shoots and roots of saltstressed cowpea and kidney bean.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1111/j.1439-037x.2007.00273.x","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Bernardo","last_name":"Murillo-Amador","affiliations":[],"email":"bmurillo04@cibnor.mx","orcid":"","h_index":15,"keywords":["adaptation","crops","Legumes","wood","drought

In this study, we constructed 16 transcriptome libraries from maize seedling roots using two maize lines, with contrasting salt tolerance, that were exposed to salt stress for 0, 6, 18 and 36 h. In total, 6,584 differential expression genes (DEGs; 3,669 upregulated, 2,915 downregulated) were induced in the salt-sensitive line and 6,419 DEGs (3,876 upregulated, 2,543 downregulated) were induced in the salt-tolerant line. Several DEGs common to both lines were enriched in the ABA signaling pathway, which was presumed to coordinate the process of maize salt response. A total of 459 DEGs were specifically induced in the salt-tolerant line and represented candidate genes responsible for high salt-tolerance. Expression pattern analysis for these DEGs indicated that the period between 0 and 6 h was a crucial period for the rapid response of the tolerant genes under salt stress. Among these DEGs, several genes, Aux/IAA, SAUR, and CBL-interacting kinase have been reported to regulate salt tolerance. In addition, the transcription factors WRKY, bZIP and MYB acted as regulators in the salt-responsive regulatory network of maize roots.

Similar to other legumes, it contains high amount of lysine rich protein (one of the essential amino acids), carbohydrates and other essential micronutrients. It can also be entitled as the cheapest source of protein. Although, comparatively it has a higher shelf life, but this legume is highly underutilized due to the omnipresence of antinutritional factors (ANF's) like protease inhibitors, amylase inhibitors, lectins, convicine and vicine, etc. Though, the amino acid profile is not complete, but other foods such as cereals and legumes can be used as complementary to each other. Due to presence of these ANF's, harmful effects are observed after its raw ingestion, overshadowing the nutritional aspects. Recent advancements in food technology like extrusion, microwave heating, fortification, extrusion, fermentation, bioprocessing, etc. along with traditional methods have given positive results, allowing human consumption and inclusion of faba beans in various novel food products. The functional characteristics of bioactive compounds, the nutritional characteristics and the results obtained after application of the above stated food processing techniques have been properly discussed in this article.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.lwt.2020.110796","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Pramod Kumar","last_name":"Prabhakar","affiliations":[],"email":"pramodkp@niftem.ac.in","orcid":"","h_index":15,"keywords":["Edible biopolymers","Oral thin films","Food packaging","Active ingredients","Shelf life","Food and pharmaceutical industries","Edible film","Edible coating","Fruit and vegetables","Packaging material","Shelf-life","Pulsed electric field","Electroporation","Starch modification","Functional properties","Food biopolymers","Food functionalisation","empirical model","growth dynamics","microbial population","rohu (Labeo rohita)","Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN)","Plantain banana","Physical characteristics","Thermal characteristics","Mathematical modelling","Fish freshness","total volatile basic nitrogen","trimethylamine (TMA-N)","temperature effect","kinetic model","activation energy","Drying kinetics","Flow Properties","Moisture diffusion","Thin layer drying models","Faba bean","Protein","Nutritional composition","Anti-nutritional factors","Bioactives","Processing and treatments","Food formulation potential","Electrospraying","coating","encapsulation","film formation","food applications","Mayonnaise","Ultrasonication","Rheological properties","Xanthan gum","Guar gum","Optical properties","Alternate plant proteins","Protein modification","Dynamic high pressure microfluidization","High shear mechanism","Emulsion stability","Foam mat drying","Jujube juice powder","Solubility","Flowability","Full factorial design (FFD)","Artificial neural network","Gaussian process regression","modeling","osmotic dehydration","Phyllanthus Emblica L.","Biological synthesis","eco-friendly","silver nanoparticles","waste utilization","models","ultrasonic","aonla","mass transfer","treatment","food processing","seed","moisture content","packaging","sup","increased linearly","engineering properties","machine","food and allied industry","functional and therapeutic properties","protein fraction","rice seed protein","Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N)","Biogenic amines","Recent innovations","mathematical modeling","complex","introduce mathematical","Modeling of Food","bioactive compounds","giloy","green extract","total phenolic content","ultrasound-assisted extraction","drying","grapefruit peel","naringin content","polyphenols","ultrasonic-assisted extraction","optimization","dairy plant","electrical","energy consumption","manufacturing","different dairy","agricultural economics","animal science","food science","genetics","plant breeding","horticulture","forestry","plant protection","soil","environment","water research","veterinary medicine","agriculture","food industry","Electric field strength","TSS","Consistency","Heating rate","Fusion","Pigmented wheat","Staple food","Food colorants","Extraction","Health benefits","Essential oil","Microbial analysis","Physico-chemical parameters","Sapota fruit juice","Sensory evaluation","Banana blossom","Microwave drying","Moisture diffusivity","diffusivity","drying dynamics","heat flux","model framework","model validation","moisture distribution","temperature distribution","processing food","quadratic","gourd seeds","ash gourd seed","explored models","Micronization techniques","Grinding","Supercritical fluid","Homogenization","Microfluidization","colour attributes","harvesting","moisture","Sphericity","Wheat","Beetroot","Non-thermal processing","Value-added products","Betalains","High pressure homogenization","plant proteins","plant based dairy products","dairy alternatives","physical modification of plant proteins","RW dryer","drying rate","diffusion models","thermal efficiency","mechanistic approach","dried product quality","hybrid foam drying","mechanistic modeling","foaming agents","computational modeling","cucurbits","fatty acid","amino acid","thermal","seed morphology","diffraction properties","antioxidant","glass transition","glycerol","oral thin film (OTFs)","pullulan","Oleogel","Oil binding capacity","Thermal stability","Smoke point","Loquat","quality characteristics","medicinal value","physiological disorders","shelf-life extension","postharvest treatments"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":8,"location":null,"raw_text":"Rahate, K.A.; Madhumita, M.; Prabhakar, P.K.

Efforts to improve salt tolerance in crop plants are vital for sustainable crop production on marginal lands to ensure future food supplies. Grain legumes are a fascinating group of plants due to their high grain protein contents and ability to fix biological nitrogen. However, the accumulation of excessive salts in soil and the use of saline groundwater are threatening legume production worldwide. Salt stress disturbs photosynthesis and hormonal regulation and causes nutritional imbalance, specific ion toxicity and osmotic effects in legumes to reduce grain yield and quality. Understanding the responses of grain legumes to salt stress and the associated tolerance mechanisms, as well as assessing management options, may help in the development of strategies to improve the performance of grain legumes under salt stress. In this manuscript, we discuss the effects, tolerance mechanisms and management of salt stress in grain legumes. The principal inferences of the review are: (i) salt stress reduces seed germination (by up to more than 50%) either by inhibiting water uptake and/or the toxic effect of ions in the embryo, (ii) salt stress reduces growth (by more than 70%), mineral uptake, and yield (by 12-100%) due to ion toxicity and reduced photosynthesis, (iii) apoplastic acidification is a good indicator of salt stress tolerance, (iv) tolerance to salt stress in grain legumes may develop through excretion and/or compartmentalization of toxic ions, increased antioxidant capacity, accumulation of compatible osmolytes, and/or hormonal regulation, (v) seed priming and nutrient management may improve salt tolerance in grain legumes, (vi) plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may help to improve salt tolerance due to better plant nutrient availability, and (vii) the integration of screening, innovative breeding, and the development of transgenics and crop management strategies may enhance salt tolerance and yield in grain legumes on salt-affected soils.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.06.020","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Muhammad","last_name":"Farooq","affiliations":[],"email":"farooqcp@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":51,"keywords":["Nutrient

Low water availability is considered the main environmental factor limiting photosynthesis and, consequently, plant growth and yield worldwide. There has been a long-standing controversy as to whether drought and salt stresses mainly limit photosynthesis through diffusive resistances or by metabolic impairment. Reviewing in vitro and in vivo measurements, it is concluded that salt and drought stress predominantly affect diffusion of CO(2) in the leaves through a decrease of stomatal and mesophyll conductances, but not the biochemical capacity to assimilate CO(2), at mild to rather severe stress levels. The general failure of metabolism observed at more severe stress suggests the occurrence of secondary oxidative stresses, particularly under high-light conditions. Estimates of photosynthetic limitations based on the photosynthetic response to intercellular CO(2) may lead to artefactual conclusions, even if patchy stomatal closure and the relative increase of cuticular conductance are taken into account, as decreasing mesophyll conductance can cause the CO(2) concentration in chloroplasts of stressed leaves to be considerably lower than the intercellular CO(2) concentration. Measurements based on the photosynthetic response to chloroplast CO(2) often confirm that the photosynthetic capacity is preserved but photosynthesis is limited by diffusive resistances in drought and salt-stressed leaves.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1055/s-2004-820867","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jaume","last_name":"Flexas","affiliations":[],"email":"jaume.flexas@uib.es","orcid":"","h_index":85,"keywords":["diffusion","EmphasisTypeItalic","models","tissues","em class","sub","photosynthetic organisms","photosynthesis","respiration","mitochondria","Gas","Atkin et al","oxygen","Rubisco","bryophyte","mesophyll conductance","photosynthetical limitations","stomatal conductance","tracheophyte","Cell wall composition","Bulk modulus of elasticity","Light-saturated CO2 assimilation","Vitis vinifera cv.

In recent past efforts have been made to improve agricultural yield through exhaustive research in nanotechnology. The green revolution resulted in blind usage of pesticides and chemical fertilizers which caused loss of soil biodiversity and developed resistance against pathogens and pests as well. Nanoparticle-mediated material delivery to plants and advanced biosensors for precision farming are possible only by nanoparticles or nanochips. Nanoencapsulated conventional fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides helps in slow and sustained release of nutrients and agrochemicals resulting in precise dosage to the plants.

Due to the significant advancements made in a number of industries, including electronics, energy, medical, cosmetics, food engineering, telecommunications, and agriculture, nanotechnology is advancing quickly. As a result, nanomaterials are the foundation of nanotechnology. Due to their small size, nanomaterials have special optical, magnetic, electrical, and physical, reactivity, strength, surface area, sensitivity, and stability features. Surprisingly, the phase change occurs when bulk materials are converted into nanomaterials, which means that materials that were previously non-magnetic become magnetic at the nanoscale. Because of its unique features, nanoscale matter is a separate form of matter from the solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma states. Nanomaterials' characteristics are mostly determined by their shapes and sizes. In this paper a critical overview of nanomaterials, their varieties, characteristics, synthesis techniques, and applications in various fields is offered.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1002/nano.202300038","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Bawoke","last_name":"Mekuye","affiliations":[],"email":"bawokemek143@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":[]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":17,"location":null,"raw_text":"Mekuye, B.; Abera, B.

A number of strategies are being followed to enhance the tolerance of abiotic stress conditions, including the development of genetically-engineered varieties containing various gene constructs believed to enhance the performance under stress conditions. Nanotechnology is a versatile field and has found application in almost all the existing fields of science. The application of nanoparticles increased germination and seedling growth, physiological activities including photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism, leaf activities of CAT, POX and APX, chlorophyll contents, protein, carbohydrate contents and yield, and also positive changes in gene expression indicating their potential use in crop improvement. Nanoparticles enhances the water stress tolerance via enhancing root hydraulic conductance and water uptake in plants and showing differential abundance of proteins involved in oxidation-reduction, ROS detoxification, stress signaling, and hormonal pathways. The mobility of the nanoparticles is very high, which leads to rapid transport of the nutrient to all parts of the plant. In particular, the most actual is to find ways to increase the adaptation potential of cultivated plants with the use of nanopreparations in stressful conditions.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.5772/intechopen.83562","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Bimal","last_name":"Das","affiliations":[],"email":"bimal.das987@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["germination","different nanoparticles","preserve knowledge","seedling growth","tomato IndianJournals.com","Gateway to access","titanium","Rice","TiO2","Experimental","seeds","Seedlings","anatase","dioxide","Enhancing Germination","gene expression","tolerance","physiology","nitrogen","adaptation","proteins","differential","abiotic stress","Gateway","storability","IndianJournals.com","early and late","late harvested","harvested potatoes","ZnO","NPs","antioxidant","protein","treatment","ppm","spinach beet","ABA","Glutathione","Lathyrus sativus","Oxidative stress","Proline","RNA-Sequencing","Salinity stress","β-ODAP"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":18,"location":null,"raw_text":"Das, A.; Das, B.

In this study, seeds of lupine (Lupinus termis) plants were grown in plastic pots and exposed to 0 (control) and 150 (S) mM NaCl with or without priming with different concentrations of ZnO [20 mg L1 (ZNPs1), 40 mg L1 (ZNPs2), and 60 mg L1 (ZNPs3)] for 20 days. Salinized plants showed a reduction in plant growth parameters (root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight) and in the contents of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoids) and Zn, as well as in the activity of catalase (CAT) against control plants. On the other side, salinity stress boosted the contents of organic solutes (soluble sugar, soluble protein, total free amino acids, and proline), total phenols, malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid and Na, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in stressed plants over control plants. However, seed-priming with ZNPs mostly stimulated growth of stressed plants, which was accompanied by reinforcement in the levels of photosynthetic pigments, organic solutes, total phenols, ascorbic acid and Zn, as well as in the activities of SOD, CAT, POD, and APX enzymes over stressed plants alone. On the contrary, priming with ZNPs caused a decrement in the contents of MDA and Na in stressed plants relative to salinized plants alone. It is worthy to mention that, this improvement in salt tolerance of plants primed with ZNPs was more obvious in plants primed with ZNPs3 and grown both in unstressed and stressed regimes. Thus, our findings suggest that seed-priming with ZNPs, especially 60 mg L1 ZnO is an effective strategy that can be used to enhance salt tolerance of lupine plants.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s00344-016-9618-x","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Arafat

The growth cycle of nCeO2 and nTiO2 treated plants was about 10 days longer than the controls. In nCeO2 treated plants the number of tillers, leaf area and the number of spikes per plant were reduced respectively by 35.5%, 28.3% and 30% (p  0.05). nTiO2 stimulated plant growth and compensated for the adverse effects of nCeO2. Concentrations of Ce and Ti in aboveground plant fractions were minute. The fate of nanomaterials within the plant tissues was different.

Nanomaterials (NMs), with a particle size less than 100 nm, influence key life events of the plants that include seed germination, seedling vigor, root initiation, growth and photosynthesis to flowering. Additionally, NMs have been implicated in the protection of plants against oxidative stress as they mimic the role of antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX). However, besides their beneficial effects on plants, applications of NMs have been proved to be phytotoxic too as they enhance the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The elevated level of ROS may damage the cellular membranes, proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore, in such a conflicting and ambiguous nature of NMs in plants, it is necessary to decipher the mechanism of cellular, biochemical and molecular protection render by NMs under stressful environmental conditions. This review systematically summarizes the role of NMs in plants under abiotic stresses such as drought, salt, temperature, metal, UV-B radiation and flooding. Furthermore, suitable strategies adopted by plants in presence of NMs under challenging environments are also being presented.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.05.038","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"M.

The regulatory mechanisms of silicon in alleviating salt stress have been widely studied using physiological, molecular genetics, and genomic approaches. Recently, progresses have been made in elucidating the alleviative effects of silicon in salt-induced osmotic stress, Na toxicity, and oxidative stress. In this review, we highlight recent development on the impact of silicon application on salt stress responses. Emphasis will be given to the following aspects. (1) Silicon transporters have been experimentally identified in different plant species and their structure feature could be an important molecular basis for silicon permeability. (2) Silicon could mediate salt-induced ion imbalance by (i) regulating Na+ uptake, transport, and distribution and (ii) regulating polyamine levels. (3) Si-mediated upregulation of aquaporin gene expression and osmotic adjustment play important roles in alleviating salinity-induced osmotic stress. (4) Silicon application direct/indirectly mitigates oxidative stress via regulating the antioxidant defense and polyamine metabolism. (5) Omics studies reveal that silicon could regulate plants response to salt stress by modulating the expression of various genes including transcription factors and hormone-related genes. Finally, research areas that require further investigation to provide a deeper understanding of the role of silicon in plants are highlighted.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/plants8060147","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Yongxing","last_name":"Zhu","affiliations":[],"email":"yongxingzhu@yangtzeu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":9,"keywords":["Puccinia

Whereas, the regeneration medium supplemented with 100 mg L1 of activated charcoal showed the highest percentage of plant regeneration (61.90%) and the ratio of the number of seedlings to the number of regenerated calli (RSR; 3.06) that derived from the callus induction medium (without activated charcoal). Moreover, the induced calli derived from the callus induction medium supplemented with nanocarbon at 5 mg L1 showed the highest percentage of callus induction (94.70%), the percentage of green spots (95.83%), the percentage of plant regeneration (60.42%) and the RSR (3.12) when transferred the calli into the regeneration medium (without nanocarbon). After that, nanocarbon was also added into the regeneration medium. The percentage of green spots (96.08%), the percentage of plant regeneration (62.75%) and the RSR (3.16) obtained from the regeneration medium supplemented with 20 mg L1 of nanocarbon showed the highest values. This experiment showed that the optimum concentration of activated charcoal and nanocarbon had potential to enhance the callus induction and plant regeneration frequencies in tissue culture medium of aromatic rice.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1080/09542299.2017.1418184","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Sutee","last_name":"Chutipaijit","affiliations":[],"email":"natadee24@hotmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":4,"keywords":["Rice","Flavonoids","Antioxidant activity","HPLC","Phenolic compounds","Activated charcoal","aromatic rice","callus induction","nanocarbon","plant regeneration","Antioxidant enzyme","Chlorophyll","Growth tolerance index","Nano-ZnO","Anthocyanin","Metabolite","Plant growth","Riceberry","ZnO nanoparticles"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":27,"location":null,"raw_text":"Chutipaijit, S.; Sutjaritvorakul, T.

Immature seeds were desiccation-tolerant at 80 days after flowering, as they were able to germinate fully after artificial drying on silica gel had reduced their water content to 1012% of fresh weight. In both endospermic and embryonic tissues, H2O2 level and, consequently, lipid peroxide content, decreased during seed development as well as after artificial dehydration of developing seeds. All examined antioxidant enzymes except DHAR showed a decrease in total activity in mature stages as compared with early stages. Expression analysis of SOD genes revealed that the decrease in total SOD activities was related to the decrease in Cu/Zn-SOD expression, while the continuous activity of SOD during maturation was related to an increase in Mn-SOD expression. Artificial drying resulted in increased SOD and DHAR activity, irrespective of the developmental stage. Our results revealed weak participation of CAT and APX in H2O2 scavenging, as well as no significant alterations in GR activities either during maturation or after artificial drying. Changes in SOD and GR isoenzyme patterns occurred during maturation-related drying, but not after artificial drying. These results highlight the role of ascorbate-glutathione cycle enzymes (DHAR and GR) in H2O2 scavenging during maturation or after artificial drying of developing J. curcas seeds.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s12374-012-0276-7","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Hazem

Recently, it was noted that most of the beneficial effects of milk come from their nanoparticles, especially exosomes. Herein, we evaluated the anticancer potential of camel milk and its exosomes on MCF7 breast cancer cells (in vitro and in vivo) and investigated the possible underlying molecular mechanism of action. Methods/Results: Administration of camel milk (orally) and its exosomes (orally and by local injection) decreased breast tumor progression as evident by (a) higher apoptosis (indicated by higher DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activity, Bax gene expression, and lower Bcl2 gene expression), (b) remarkable inhibition of oxidative stress (decrease in MDA levels and iNOS gene expression); (c) induction of antioxidant status (increased activities of SOD, CAT, and GPX), (d) notable reduction in expression of inflammation-(IL1b, NFκB), angiogenesis-(VEGF) and metastasis-(MMP9, ICAM1) related genes; and (e) higher immune response (high number of CD+4, CD+8, NK1.1 T cells in spleen). Conclusions: Overall, administration of camel milkderived exosomes showed better anticancer effect, but less immune response, than treatment by camel milk. Moreover, local injection of exosomes led to better improvement than oral administration. These findings suggest that camel milk and its exosomes have anticancer effect possibly through induction of apoptosis and inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, angiogenesis and metastasis in the tumor microenvironment. Thus, camel milk and its exosomes could be used as an anticancer agent for cancer treatment.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1177/1534735418786000","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Abdelnaser

Salinity stress impacts many aspects of a plants physiology, making it difficult to study in toto. Instead, it is more tractable to dissect the plants response into traits that are hypothesized to be involved in the overall tolerance of the plant to salinity. Scope and conclusions We discuss how to quantify the impact of salinity on different traits, such as relative growth rate, water relations, transpiration, transpiration use efficiency, ionic relations, photosynthesis, senescence, yield and yield components. We also suggest some guidelines to assist with the selection of appropriate experimental systems, imposition of salinity stress, and obtaining and analysing relevant physiological data using appropriate indices. We illustrate how these indices can be used to identify relationships amongst the proposed traits to identify which traits are the most important contributors to salinity tolerance. Salinity tolerance is complex and involves many genes, but progress has been made in studying the mechanisms underlying a plants response to salinity. Nevertheless, several previous studies on salinity tolerance could have benefited from improved experimental design. We hope that this paper will provide pertinent information to researchers on performing proficient assays and interpreting results from salinity tolerance experiments.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1093/aob/mcw191","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Sónia","last_name":"Negrão","affiliations":[],"email":"sonia.negrao@ucd.ie","orcid":"","h_index":22,"keywords":["Rice","Salinity","Forward

Roots of A. cepa were treated with different concentrations of NaCl (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 mM), and cytological and physiological indicators in the root of plant were measured in different processing time. With the increase of NaCl concentrations and processing time, mitotic activity and relative division rate (RDR) were reduced. However, during recovery, mitotic activity and RDR were restored but their values were less than control values. Salt stress caused an increase while in recovery experiments there was a slight reduction in chromosomal aberrations. A significant increase in SOD and POX activities except in 200 mM occurred after 18 h of stress which was still higher than control in recovered plants. CAT activity showed 53.90 % decrease after 18 h of salt stress and also a significant decrease was observed after 24 h post stress. The results suggest that at high salt stress up to 150 mM, the roots of A. cepa are capable to rapidly activate antioxidant defence system to resist the salt-induced oxidative stress, but could not control the cytogenetical activities. The results also suggest that the recovery is possible at physiological and cytogenetical level by retaining chromosomal and DNA integrity.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s40415-015-0216-0","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Divya","last_name":"Singh","affiliations":[],"email":"divya.ds012@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":4,"keywords":["Abnormalities","Antioxidant enzyme","Post stress","Salt stress","Pseudogenes","Gene expression","Noncoding RNA","Transcription","RNA","Cancer","tissues","immunohistochemistry","score","CagA","Gastric","Her2 Expression","Pylori","Plant sciences","Plant stress responses","Environmental sciences","Binding energy","Biotransformation","Curcumin","Molecular docking","SARS-CoV-2","main protease","S1 receptor-binding domain","curcuminoids","conventional drugs","pharmacokinetic properties","ANCHOR"]},{"first_name":"Bijoy Krishna","last_name":"Roy","affiliations":[],"email":"bijoykrishnabotany12@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["CagA","Curcumin","Docking","Drugs","Ligand","Genotoxicity","Food preservatives","Mitotic index","Chromosomal abnormalities","Allium cepa","Helicobacter pylori","Residues","salt","tolerance","isolates","Bacillus","Cassia","Bacterial Endophytes","Pseudomonas Sp","endophytic","Abnormalities","Antioxidant enzyme","Post stress","Salt stress","Malathion","Mitotic activities","Antioxidant enzymes","Binding energy","Biotransformation","Molecular docking"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":41,"location":null,"raw_text":"Singh, D.; Roy, B.K.

Due to its heavy use in industry and daily life, such as food additives, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and paints, many residues are released into the environment and currently TiO2 nanoparticles are considered an emerging environmental contaminant. Although several studies have shown the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on a wide range of organisms including bacteria, algae, plankton, fish, mice, and rats, little research has been performed on land plants. In this study, we investigated the effect of TiO2 nanoparticles on the growth, development, and gene expression of tobacco, an important economic and agricultural crop in the southeastern USA as well as around the world. We found that TiO2 nanoparticles significantly inhibited the germination rates, root lengths, and biomasses of tobacco seedlings after 3 weeks of exposure to 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 % TiO2 nanoparticles and that overall growth and development of the tobacco seedlings significantly decreased as TiO2 nanoparticle concentrations increased. Overall, tobacco roots were the most sensitive to TiO2 nanoparticle exposure. Nano-TiO2 also significantly influenced the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs), a recently discovered class of small endogenous noncoding RNAs (2022 nt) that are considered important gene regulators and have been shown to play an important role in plant development as well as plant tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, cold, and heavy metal. Low concentrations (0.1 and 1 %) of TiO2 nanoparticles dramatically induced miRNA expression in tobacco seedlings with miR395 and miR399 exhibiting the greatest fold changes of 285-fold and 143-fold, respectively. The results of this study show that TiO2 nanoparticles have a negative impact on tobacco growth and development and that miRNAs may play an important role in tobacco response to heavy metals/nanoparticles by regulating gene expression.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s10142-013-0341-4","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Baohong","last_name":"Zhang","affiliations":[],"email":"zhangb@ecu.edu","orcid":"","h_index":44,"keywords":["microRNA","Precursor","Minimal

It is virtually confined to coastal salt marshes, where it often dominates the vegetation. The aim of this study was to investigate its growth responses to salinity and the extent to which these could be explained by photosynthetic physiology. The responses of young plants to salinity in the range 0700 mol m3 NaCl were investigated in a glasshouse experiment. The performance of plants was examined using classical growth analysis, measurements of gas exchange (infrared gas analysis), determination of chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics (modulated fluorimeter) and photosynthetic pigment concentrations; total ash, sodium, potassium and nitrogen concentrations, and relative water content were also determined. Plants accumulated Na+ approximately in proportion to external salinity. Salt stimulated growth up to an external concentration of 200 mol m3 NaCl and some growth was maintained at higher salinities. The main determinant of growth response to salinity was unit leaf rate. This was itself reflected in rates of CO2 assimilation, which were not affected by 200 mol m3 but were reduced at higher salinities. Reductions in net photosynthetic rate could be accounted for largely by lower stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration. Apart from possible effects of osmotic shock at the beginning of the experiment, salinity did not have any adverse effect on photosystem II (PSII). Neither the quantum efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) nor the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) were reduced by salinity, and lower mid-day values recovered by dawn. Mid-day Fv/Fm was in fact depressed more at low external sodium concentration, by the end of the experiment. The growth responses of the hygro-halophyte A. portulacoides to salinity appear largely to depend on changes in its rate of photosynthetic gas exchange. Photosynthesis appears to be limited mainly through stomatal conductance and hence intercellular CO2 concentration, rather than by effects on PSII; moderate salinity might stimulate carboxylation capacity. This is in contrast to more extreme halophytes, for which an ability to maintain leaf area can partially offset declining rates of carbon assimilation at high salinity.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1093/aob/mcm119","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"Redondo-Gómez","affiliations":[],"email":"susana@us.es","orcid":"","h_index":34,"keywords":["Tolerance","stresses","physiology","survival","environmental stress","abiotic","drought","chapter","pathogen","Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)","heavy metals","Spartina maritima","root respiration","Oxygen-isotope fractionation","Oxidative Stress","carbon balance","bioremediation","Chlorophyll fluorescence","Gas exchange","Halophyte","Ion homeostasis","NaCl-Stress","Photosynthesis","Rhizoremediation","Greenhouse","Conservation","bioaugmentation","Odiel","Piedras","Water","electronic transport","Growth","CO2 enrichment","Climate change","Temperature stress","Soil degradation","Plant productivity","Biofertilizers","PGPR","Endophytes","Omics","Intraspecific variability","Local adaptation","Non-indigenous species","Warming stress","anatomy","Arthrocnemum macrostachyum","O2 evolution","Salicornia ramosissima","Sarcocornia fruticosa","Sarcocornia perennis ssp. alpini","Sarcocornia perennis ssp. perennis","Sarcocornia perennis×fruticosa","germination","growth rate","photosystem II","salt tolerance","seed dimorphism","seed viability","Suaeda splendens","Antioxidant enzyme activities","cordgrass","salinity","synergic effect","zinc","Chl a","chlorophyll a","Chl b","chlorophyll b","intercellular CO2 concentration","Cx + c","carotenoids","minimal fluorescence level in the dark-adapted state","maximal fluorescence level in the dark-adapted state","variable fluorescence level in the dark-adapted state","Fv/Fm","maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry","ΦPSII","quantum efficiency of PSII","stomatal conductance","NPQ","non-photochemical quenching","net photosynthetic rate","RGR","relative growth rate","phenanthrene","densiflora","soil","Spartina","survived","treatments","1000mgkg","concentrations","pigments","chronic photoinhibition","dynamic photoinhibition","herbicide","olea europaea","Olive trees","Dichlorophenyl","Dimethylurea","Simazine","Soil Herbicide","Olive Crops","quantum efficiency","Antioxidative enzyme activity","Fluorescence","Growth parameters","Mineral nutrients","Photoinhibition","depth","tolerance.","bacteria","Metabarcoding","Rio Piedras","Salt marsh","Halophytes","Microbial ecology","biofertilizer","CO2","halophilic rhizobacteria","plant biomass","soil salinization","temperature","heavy metal stress","rhizobia","legumes","stress related genes","ROS-scavenging enzymes","biofilms","scanning electron microscopy","osmotic stress","pre-conditioning","root microbiota","rhizomicrobiome","cash crop","Spain","biofortification","iron","Triticum aestivum","plant growth promoting rhizobacteria","Bacillus","polymeric nanoparticles","cereals","arid soils","ACC deaminase","nodule associated bacteria","anthocyanins","Beta vulgaris L.","flavonoids","nutrient content","phenolics","pigment concentrations","specific conductivity","turgor loss point","petroleum-derived substances (PDS)","chlorophyll a fluorescence","abiotic stress","legume nodulation","plant-growth-promoting endophytes","degraded soils","plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)","nodulation-enhancing rhizobacteria (NER)","nutrient poverty","Medicago","elevated atmospheric CO2","flowering","inoculation","nutrient deficit","phosphorous","strawberry","nutritional quality","plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria","gas chromatography","spectrophotometry","Arthrocaulon (Arthrocnemum) macrostachyum","inoculant","PGP","cutting","Vitis vinifera","heatwave stress","stress physiology","PGPB","root inoculation","halotolerant bacteria","ice plant","synthetic communities","culturomics","metalloids","metabolomics","legumes nodulation","plant growth promoting endophytes","SynCom","degraded estuarine soils","bacterial consortium","efficiency of PSII photochemistry","bacterial consortia","plant-based culture medium","root colonization","Phytostabilisation","Temperature rise","contaminated","tolerant","Spartina densiflora","metal uptake","photosynthetic","tolerance to heavy","capacity for accumulating","Europe","salt","PSII","maritima","μmol","Photosynthetic pigments","Spartina densiflora.

Plants cultivated on soil were challenged for 2 weeks with NaCl. Arabidopsis showed a much higher sensitivity to salt than Thellungiella; while Arabidopsis plants were unable to survive exposure to greater than 150 mM salt, Thellugiella could tolerate concentrations as high as 500 mM with only minimal effects on gas exchange. Exposure of Arabidopsis to sublethal salt concentrations resulted in stomatal closure and inhibition of CO2 fixation. This lead to an inhibition of electron transport though photosystem II (PSII), an increase in cyclic electron flow involving only PSI, and increased nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. In contrast, in Thellungiella, although gas exchange was marginally inhibited by high salt and PSI was unaffected, there was a large increase in electron flow involving PSII. This additional electron transport activity is oxygen dependent and sensitive to the alternative oxidase inhibitor n-propyl gallate. PSII electron transport in Thellungiella showed a reduced sensitivity to 2'-iodo-6-isopropyl-3-methyl-2',4,4'-trinitrodiphenylether, an inhibitor of the cytochrome b(6)f complex. At the same time, we observed a substantial up-regulation of a protein reacting with antibodies raised against the plastid terminal oxidase. No such up-regulation was seen in Arabidopsis. We conclude that in salt-stressed Thellungiella, plastid terminal oxidase acts as an alternative electron sink, accounting for up to 30% of total PSII electron flow.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1104/pp.108.132407","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Piotr","last_name":"Stępień","affiliations":[],"email":"piotr.stepien@upwr.edu.pl","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["Dry

Shoot biomass of both genotypes was substantially reduced by salinity, but genotypic differences appeared only after 3 weeks, when durum cultivar Wollaroi showed greater leaf injury and a greater reduction in biomass than Line 455. Ion accumulation, water relations, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange were followed on one leaf (leaf 3) throughout its life. Salinity caused a large decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) of both genotypes. This was not due to poor water relations, as leaf turgor of both genotypes was higher in the salt treatment than in controls, so chemical signals were likely to have caused the decrease in gs. Reductions in assimilation rate were initially due to gs and, with time, were due to a combination of stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. The non-stomatal limitations were associated with a build up of Na+ above 250 mM. The efficiency of PSII photochemistry in Line 455 was unaffected throughout. However, in Wollaroi, the potential and actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry began to decline as the leaf aged and the thermal energy dissipation of excess light energy (NPQ) increased. This coincided with high Na+ and Cl concentrations in the leaf and with chlorophyll degradation, indicating that these later reductions in CO2 assimilation in Wollaroi were a consequence of a direct toxic ion effect. The earlier reduction in CO2 assimilation and greater leaf injury explain why growth of Wollaroi was less than Line 455. The most sensitive indicator of salinity stress was gs, followed by CO2 assimilation, with fluorescence parameters other than NPQ being no more sensitive than chlorophyll itself.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1071/fp02069","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Richard

Camphor trees have good ecological and environmental benefits and are economic, which makes them worthy of widespread popularization and promotion. In this paper, we successfully synthesized bulk and rod-like TiO2 powder and used it to study the influence of camphor seed germination and seedling growth. The germination rate, germination potential, germination index activity index of camphorwood seed during germination were measured by TiO2 solution with different morphology. Meanwhile, the fresh weight, root length and seedling height of seedlings, as well as the activities of CAT, SOD and POD and MDA content in the seedlings were measured in detail. The difference in the promoting effect between bulk and rod TiO2 powder was compared. The possible reasons are also explained. The results showed that bulk and rod-like TiO2 solution improved the activities of SOD, POD and CAT, and increased the resilience of camphor seedlings. Moreover, the rod-like TiO2 solution has a stronger osmotic effect on seed, and has a better effect on promoting seed germination and seedling growth. The study on the influence of nano-TiO2 concentration also further showed that the treatment of nano-TiO2 solution with appropriate concentration could effectively promote seed germination and seedling growth, and enhance its adoptability to adversity; but excessive concentration will bring some side effects, which was not conducive to seed germination and seedling growth. In general, the results of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the practical application of nanotechnology in camphor seedling and afforestation production.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/nano12071047","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"You","last_name":"Zhou","affiliations":[],"email":"zhouyouhuhst@126.com","orcid":"","h_index":0,"keywords":["camphor tree","nano titanium dioxide","seed germination","seedling growth","concentration"]},{"first_name":"Lei","last_name":"Zhang","affiliations":[],"email":"lei.zhang01@ulink.com","orcid":"","h_index":0,"keywords":["camphor tree","nano titanium dioxide","seed germination","seedling growth","concentration"]},{"first_name":"Yaodi","last_name":"Liu","affiliations":[],"email":"liuyd0222@163.com","orcid":"","h_index":0,"keywords":["camphor tree","nano titanium dioxide","seed germination","seedling growth","concentration","groundwater","solid phase extraction (SPE)","ultra-high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole instrument (UHPLC-MS/MS)","n-nitrosamine compounds"]},{"first_name":"Jiyun","last_name":"She","affiliations":[],"email":"shejiyun2022@163.com","orcid":"","h_index":0,"keywords":["camphor tree","nano titanium dioxide","seed germination","seedling growth","concentration"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":49,"location":null,"raw_text":"Zhou, Y.; Zhang, L.; Liu, Y.; She, J.

The results showed that hydrogen peroxide and MDA contents and electrolyte leakage index (ELI) increased under CS conditions in both genotypes and that these damage indices were higher in ILC533 than in Sel11439 plants. In plants treated with TiO2 NPs, a decreased H2O2 level was accompanied by a decrease in the MDA content and ELI compared to control plants, and these changes occurred more effectively in Sel11439 than in ILC533 plants. The antioxidant enzymes were more effective in cell protection against CS in Sel11439 plants compared to ILC533 plants, as well as in plants treated with TiO2 NPs compared to control plants. The lipoxygenase activity was induced efficiently only in Sel11439 plants treated with TiO2 NPs during CS, probably indicating its role in stress response (which was confirmed by measuring allen oxide synthase activity). TiO2 NPs caused stability of chlorophyll and carotenoid contents during CS. Results suggest that TiO2 NPs confer an increased tolerance of chickpea plants to CS, decreasing the level of injuries and increasing the capacity of defense systems.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1134/s1021443714050124","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Reza","last_name":"Maali-Amiri","affiliations":[],"email":"rmamiri@ut.ac.ir","orcid":"","h_index":19,"keywords":["tolerant","energy

The increased applications lead to the subsequent release of nanomaterials in environment that could affect the plant productivity. However, few studies have been performed to determine the overall effects of TiO2NPs on edible crops. We treated tomato plants with 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 g/L TiO2NPs in a hydroponic system for two weeks and examined physiological, biochemical and molecular changes.. The dual response was observed on growth and photosynthetic ability of plants depending on TiO2NPs concentrations. Low concentrations (0.52 g/L) of TiO2NPs boosted growth by approximately 50% and caused significant increase in photosynthetic parameters such as quantum yield, performance index, and total chlorophyll content as well as induced expression of PSI gene with respect to untreated plants . The high concentration (4g/L) affected these parameters in negative manner. The catalase and peroxidase activities were also elevated in the exposed plants in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, exposed plants exhibited increased expressions of glutathione synthase and glutathione S-transferase (nearly 3-fold increase in both roots and leaves), indicating a promising role of thiols in detoxification of TiO2NPs in tomato. The elemental analysis of tissues performed at 0.5, 1 and 2 g/L TiO2NPs indicates that TiO2NPs transport significantly affected the distribution of essential elements (P, S, Mg and Fe) in roots and leaves displaying about three fold increases in P and 25% decrease in Fe contents. This study presents the mechanistic basis for the differential responses of titanium nanoparticles in tomato, and calls for a cautious approach for the application of nanomaterials in agriculture.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3389/fpls.2017.00633","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Manish","last_name":"Tiwari","affiliations":[],"email":"maneeshtiwari11@yahoo.co.in","orcid":"","h_index":18,"keywords":["Arsenic","Rice","Transporter","Heavy

While previous proposals consider rutile as a passive electron sink hindering recombination in anatase, this research details the critical and active role of rutile in TiO2 formulations. The inactivity of pure-phase rutile is due in part to rapid rates of recombination. Yet, in mixed-phase TiO2, charges produced on rutile by visible light are stabilized through electron transfer to lower energy anatase lattice trapping sites. These results suggest that within mixed-phase titania (P25) there is a morphology of nanoclusters containing atypically small rutile crystallites interwoven with anatase crystallites. The transition points between these two phases allow for rapid electron transfer from rutile to anatase. Thus, rutile acts as an antenna to extend the photoactivity into visible wavelengths and the structural arrangement of the similarly sized TiO2 crystallites creates catalytic hot spots at the rutileanatase interface.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1021/jp0273934","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Alexander George","last_name":"Agrios","affiliations":[],"email":"agrios@engr.uconn.edu","orcid":"","h_index":17,"keywords":["aerogels","image processing","porous electrodes","surface characterization","tin oxide","Aquatic organisms","Nanoparticles","Photocatalytic","Titanium dioxide","Perovskite solar cells","Vacuum impregnation","Optoelectronics","Platelets","Organometallic assembly","4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA)","Pt-S bond","reaction rate","reaction mechanism","surface area","photocatalysis","chemical sciences","dye sensitized solar cell","layer by layer","Degussa","EPR","recombination","mixed phase","sub","structural","anatase","rutile","band gap","TiO2","Sintering temperature","Benzene derivatives","Dichloroacetic acid","microbial fuel cells","electrode kinetics","anode","platinum","organic substrates","Single Chamber","energy conversion","physical chemistry","charge transfer","nanocomposites","doping","zinc oxide","antimony-doped tin oxide","transparent conducting oxides","treatment","cathode area","SCMFCs","membraneless","power generation","slightly","fuel","OCP","Anodic","circuit potential","dramatically","open","regioisomers","Dye sensitized solar cells","atomic layer deposition","ZnO-TiO2 nanocomposites","ZnO","chlorophenols","245TCP","Irradiation","bandgap","polymeric product","form CTCs","trichlorophenol","nanostructured materials","plasma probes","plasma production","zinc compounds","electrical stress","light emission","nanoforest","plasma","epoxide initiated sol","SnO","additive in epoxide","Fluoride additive","Platinum nanoparticles","Nanocatalysts","Phase-transfer synthesis","ANOVA","Mixed phase TiO2","Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)","Interfacial charge transfer","Organic dye","Mesoporous TiO2","Hole conduction","Triarylamine","Electron transport","Micro porous layer (MPL)","Gas diffusion layer (GDL)","Cathode structure","two-layer cathode structure composed of catalyst layer and gas diffusion layer (CL + GDL)","three-layer cathode structure composed of catalyst layer","micro porous layer and gas diffusion layer (CL + MPL + GDL)","CBL","carbon based layer","catalyst layer","COD","Chemical oxygen demand","Ecell","Overall open circuit potential (OCPcathode−OCPanode)","GAC","granulated activated carbon","GDL","gas diffusion layer","multi-layer cathode structure composed of catalyst layer","carbon based layer and four PTFE layers (CL + GDL + CBL+4 PTFE layers)","electrode","Structures","optimize","microbial","coulombic","Highest","treating wastewater","conformational","annulation","chromene","bacteriochlorin","fluorescence","extent","diol","vis","planarized"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":57,"location":null,"raw_text":"Hurum, D.C.; Agrios, A.G.; Gray, K.A.; Rajh, T.; Thurnauer, M.C.

Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to act as an important stress signaling molecule during plant responses to abiotic stresses. The present work was planned to investigate the involvement of endogenous NO in nTiO2-induced activation of defense system of fava bean (Vicia faba L.) plants under water-deficit stress (WDS) conditions. Water-suffered plants showed increased concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2) content coupled with increased electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation which adversely affected nitrate reductase (NR) activity, chlorophyll content and growth of the plants. However, application of 15 mg L1 nTiO2 to stressed plants significantly induced NR activity and synthesis of NO which elevated enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense system of the stressed plants and suppressed the generation of H2O2 and O2 content, leakage of electrolytes, and lipid peroxidation. Application of nTiO2, in association with NO, also enhanced the accumulation of osmolytes (proline and glycine betaine) that assisted the stressed plants in osmotic adjustment as witnessed by improved hydration level of the plants. Involvement of NO in nTiO2-induced activation of defense system was confirmed with NO scavenger cPTIO [2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide] which caused recurrence of WDS.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.110152","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"M.

To contribute to the evaluation of the potential harmful effects of the nanoparticles on monocots and dicots we considered their effects on seed germination and root elongation applying a concentration range from 0.2 to 4.0 in the plants Zea mays L. and Vicia narbonensis L. Moreover, we achieved a genotoxicity study at cytological level in root meristems by means of traditional cytogenetic approach, to evidence possible alterations in mitotic activity, chromosomal aberrations, and micronuclei release. From these analyses it comes out that nano-TiO2 particles, after short-term exposure and under our experimental conditions, delayed germination progression for the first 24 h in both materials. Root elongation was affected only after treatment with the higher nano-TiO2 concentration. Further significant effects were detected showing mitotic index reduction and concentration-dependent increase in the aberration emergence that evidenced a nano-TiO2-induced genotoxic effect for both species.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s11051-010-0135-8","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Monica Ruffini","last_name":"Castiglione","affiliations":[],"email":"monica.ruffini.castiglione@unipi.it","orcid":"","h_index":25,"keywords":["zinc oxide","indole-3-acetic acid","lateral root","rice","bulk particle","nanoparticle","Anthocyanin","Chlorophyll fluorescence","Gas exchange","Metabolomics","Polyphenol","Stomatal density","Anthropogenic change","Chemical ecology","Priming","Spodoptera littoralis","Noctuidae","Plant nutraceutical","Feeding behavior","Plant–insect tolerance","Marine litter","Oxidative stress","Photosynthetic efficiency","Nanoparticles","Cymodocea nodosa","Cadmium","Charophytes","Iron","Metals","Phytochelatins","Phytochelatin synthase","ESI-MS","electrospray ionization mass-spectrometry","GSH","reduced glutathione","MS/MS","tandem mass spectrometry","phytochelatin","PCS","stress","survive","macrocarpa","curcas","oil","freezing temperatures","cold","pigments","seed","agricultural soil","anatase nanoparticles","cell ultrastructure","crystalline phase","micro-XANES","micro-XRF","pea roots","rutile nanoparticles","TEM","titanium dioxide nanoparticles","bulk zinc oxide","foliar spray","root zone treatment","Triticum turgidum","zinc oxide nanoparticles","AMF","lipid peroxidation","Myzus persicae","ROS","volatile organic compounds","Embryo","Endosperm","Nucleases and RNases","Seed ageing","Triticum durum Desf.","germination energy","middle viable","non-viable","room temperature","SSPN","single-strand-preferring nuclease","TBA","thiobarbituric acid","TBA-rm","thiobarbituric acid-reactive material","viable.","methylation","geometry","polystyrene","antigen","soluble","binding","monoclonal antibody","methylcytidine","albinism","DNA content","ITS sequences","protein pattern","RuBisCO","barley","DNA modulation","meiosis","oil palm","Cytogenetic anomalies","Organogenesis","Somaclonal variation","Somatic embryogenesis","interphase","acetylation","bacterial artificial chromosome","euchromatin","heterochromatin","nucleolus organizer region","repetitive dna","dna methylation","histones","Abiotic stress","Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis","Nicotiana","Rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR)","Achromobacter sp.","Bioaugmentation","Biosurfactants","Genotoxicity","Phytotoxicity","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Sphingomonas sp.","Vicia faba L.","Elaeis guineensis Jacq","quantitative DNA modulation","microdensitometry","regeneration system","somatic","hypermethylation","Album","Female Cells","Two X Chromosomes","auxin","flavonol","Glucosinolate","phenylpropanoid","Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae)","Glutathione","Heavy metal","HPLC-ESI-MS-MS","Isotope-labelled internal standard","Mass spectrometry","Thiol-peptide","Anatase and rutile","Mineral nutrition","Pea plants","Soil bacterial communities","Soil organic amendment","Azolla filiculoides","Histochemistry","TiO2 nanoparticles","TiO2particles","Chromosomal","aberrations","Root ultrastructure","Particles internalization","α subunit (RHDα) aromatic ring hydroxylating dioxygenases","dynamic biopile","Pleurotus ostreatus","spent mushroom substrate","Vicia faba L","Antioxidant response","Willow","Allium cepa L.","Polystyrene nanoplastics","Ultrastructural analysis","differentiation","treatments","fern","induces stress","root","Pteris","hyperaccumulator","vittata","nucleolus","cladistic analysis","internal transcribed spacer","rdna phenotypes","igs intergenic spacer","malate dehydroge- nase","two-dimensional electrophoresis","sdp slowly developing plants.","rdna slv spacer length variant of ribosomal dna","spacer length vari- ants. abbreviations: fdp fast developing plants","phaseolus coccineus","mdh malate dehydrogenase","developmental phase","DNA","5-methylcytidine antibody","Immunogold Localization","Methylcytosine Rich","Polytene Chromosomes","suspensor","phylogeny","ribosomal dna","optical density","dna sequence","karyotypes","chromosome banding","chromatin organization","image analysis","plant chromosomes","Triticum","cv.

This defence is brought about by alteration in the pattern of gene expression: qualitative and quantitative changes in proteins are the result, leading to modulation of certain metabolic and defensive pathways. Abiotic stresses usually cause protein dysfunction. They have an ability to alter the levels of a number of proteins which may be soluble or structural in nature. Nowadays, in higher plants high-throughput protein identification has been made possible along with improved protein extraction, purification protocols and the development of genomic sequence databases for peptide mass matches. Thus, recent proteome analysis performed in the vegetal Kingdom has provided new dimensions to assess the changes in protein types and their expression levels under abiotic stress. As reported in this review, specific and novel proteins, protein-protein interactions and post-translational modifications have been identified, which play a role in signal transduction, anti-oxidative defence, anti-freezing, heat shock, metal binding etc. However, beside specific proteins production, plants respond to various stresses in a similar manner by producing heat shock proteins (HSPs), indicating a similarity in the plant's adaptive mechanisms; in plants, more than in animals, HSPs protect cells against many stresses. A relationship between ROS and HSP also seems to exist, corroborating the hypothesis that during the course of evolution, plants were able to achieve a high degree of control over ROS toxicity and are now using ROS as signalling molecules to induce HSPs.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.jprot.2008.07.005","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Anna

Consequently, the D1:1 turnover does not match photoinactivation of PSII under increased irradiance and therefore the cells containing this D1 form exhibit a decrease in the PSII activity. Monitoring of the content of each D1 form during a recovery from growthtemperature photoinhibition showed a good correlation between the synthesis of D1:2 and restoration of the PSII activity. In contrast, when photoinhibitory treatment was conducted at low temperature, a fast recovery was not accompanied by the D1:2 accumulation. The data suggest that photoinactivation at growth temperature results in a modification of PSII that inhibits insertion of D1:1 and, therefore, for restoration of the photochemical activity in the photoinactivated PSII complexes the D1:2 synthesis is needed. This may represent the primary reason for the requirement of psbAII/psbAIII expression under increased irradiance.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/s0005-2728(00)00105-5","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Josef","last_name":"Komenda","affiliations":[],"email":"komenda@alga.cz","orcid":"","h_index":41,"keywords":["functional","photosystem II","Oxygen","complex","structural","biogenesis","Protein Subunit","Oxygenic photosynthesis","Photosystem I","Chlorophyll","Ribosome","SecY translocon","YidC","Assembly factors","proteins","contaminated","easily","detergents","thylakoid","multicomponent","Ii Assembly","Assembly Steps","Synechocystis Sp","Pcc6803","Cyanobacterium Synechocystis","Phosphorylation","photoinactivation","PsbH protein","spinach","Spnacia oleracea","Membrane Biogenesis","Membrane Enzymes","Membrane Proteins","Photosynthesis","Protein Assembly","Chlorophyll Proteins","Thylakoid Membrane","gene expression","Protein","assembly","immunoblot","Chelatase","Gun4","photoinhibition","D1 turnover","assembly factor","membrane protein","FtsH protease","Deg protease","Iron","Burning Study","hole burning","Dunaliella Tertiolecta","Antenna Proteins","Tertiolecta Affected","structure","GST","viability","functionally","FtsH3","FtsH2","model","Synechocystis","immunoblotting","hollandica","Pcb antenna","Prochlorothrix","function","periphery","CP47","vicinity of the PsbH","core complex","PSII core","light harvesting complexes","leaves","chlorophyll fluorescence","degradation","heating","temperature","stability","protein complex","light harvesting complex","fluorescence","thermal stability","tagged","photosystem","PSII","Nanogold","Chl","ferrochelatase","CP47 mutant","CP47 protein","photosystem II assembly","protein synthesis","Synechocystis sp.

The loss-of-function mutations in lsd1 cause runaway cell death triggered by reactive oxygen species. lsd1 encodes a novel zinc finger protein with unknown biochemical activities. Here, we report the identification of CATALASE3 (CAT3) as an lsd1-interacting protein by affinity purification and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. The Arabidopsis genome contains three homologous catalase genes (CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3). Yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated that lsd1 interacted with all three catalases both in vitro and in vivo, and the interaction required the zinc fingers of lsd1. We found that the catalase enzymatic activity was reduced in the lsd1 mutant, indicating that the catalase enzyme activity was partially dependent on lsd1. Consistently, the lsd1 mutant was more sensitive to the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole than the wild type, suggesting that the interaction between lsd1 and catalases is involved in the regulation of the reactive oxygen species generated in the peroxisome. Genetic studies revealed that lsd1 interacted with CATALASE genes to regulate light-dependent runaway cell death and hypersensitive-type cell death. Moreover, the accumulation of salicylic acid was required for PCD regulated by the interaction between lsd1 and catalases. These results suggest that the lsd1-catalase interaction plays an important role in regulating PCD in Arabidopsis.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1104/pp.113.225805","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Jianru","last_name":"Zuo","affiliations":[],"email":"jrzuo@genetics.ac.cn","orcid":"","h_index":36,"keywords":["expression of several genes","carbon flux","developing seeds","fatty acid biosynthesis","seed oil","CKI1","cytokinin","histidine","regulation","gametophytic lethality","mutant allele","acts upstream","female gametophytic lethal","cell death","Involved in Intracellular Transport","Intracellular Transport of Paraquat","Arabidopsis","transporters","lsd1","catalase","runaway cell death","small caps","differentiation","AHP6","cytokinin regulated","regulates","root","Translation Initiation","defective protoxylem","Fd-GOGAT","carbon–nitrogen balance","genetic variations","nitrogen assimilation","rice","GSNOR1","Nitric oxide","PRMT5","S-nitrosylation","protein methylation","stress responses","GSNO reductase","selective autophagy","hypoxia responses","nitrogen utilization","Ghd7-ARE1","transcriptional repression","molecular breeding","transnitrosylation","non-canonical catalase","ROG1","Arabidopsis thaliana","Auxin","Aux","IAA","S -nitrosylation","Intrinsically disordered region","Leaf senescence","Pheophorbide a oxygenase","Targeting","Transit peptide","Biological sciences"," Plant sciences"," Cell biology","protein","functional","nitrosylation","diverse","plants","plant development","biological processes","challenges","Gibberellin","DELLA repressors","stress","survival","salt tolerance","coordinate the balance between growth","ARE4","OsHXK7","glucose signaling","nitrate","Intermediate Production","Sphingoid bases","Mediating Reactive","Oxygen Intermediate","Involvement of Sphingoid","apoptosis","cell growth","cr","cancer","immunology","chloroplast","Journal","carotenoid","Carotene","Erratum","monthly","Encompasses","Fluorescence imaging","Rhodamine B thiolactone","Hg2+ uptake","Plant system","Korrigan","cytokinesis","glucanase","Arabidopsis Endo","Polarized Targeting","cell plate","neurodegeneration","Response regulator","ARR18","Receiver domain","programmed cell death","Functional Genomics","Chemical Inducible","LexA","Biotechnology","XVE","overexpression","VP16","silencing","estrogen","WUSCHEL/PGA6","somatic embryogenesis","activation tagging","transcription factor","seed","NF YA1","embryogenesis","somatic","function","cell","morphogenesis","signal transduction","transcription factors","plant leaves","gtp binding proteins","Plant biology","GMO","marker-free transformation","marker removal","transformation","regeneration","transporting plastid","plastid fatty acids","sup","filling stage","auxin signaling","represses","Cys","IAA17","model","TUTOU1","Encodes a Suppressor","Panicle","protein affects","actin nucleation","ROS","PCD","chloroplasts","malate","DEHYDROGENASE","triggers","TRANSPORTER","Oryza sativa L.","domestication","grain size","grain weight","quantitative trait loci","low temperature","reactive oxygen species (ROS)","treatment","stress proteins","heat shock","viability","Pattern recognition receptors in plants","Plant signalling","Life Sciences","general","Plant Sciences","MG132","protein stability","type-A ARR","PPR protein","ETC","mitochondria","say","ABA signaling","guard cells","Ost1","Bestatin","Chelate Reductase","Arabidopsis Research","Abscisic Acid Receptor","Plant Biology Research","proteins","phosphorylation","cytokinin signalling","AHP1","phosphorelay","phosphotransfer","ARR1","two-component system","mutations","Ascorbate Peroxidase Activity","nitrosylated proteins","regulated","chlorophyll","GSNO","nitrogen","ARE1","NUE","grain yield","mediate","limiting conditions","oscillations","circadian clock","BE1","plant growth and development","encodes a putative glycoside","Encoding a Putative Glycoside Hydrolase","FLC","fld-5","flowering","short root","endo-1,4-β-glucanase","map-based cloning","Chinese scientists","Cold Sensing","Scientists Made Breakthrough","Breakthrough Progresses"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":64,"location":null,"raw_text":"Li, Y.; Chen, L.; Mu, J.; Zuo, J.

However, the regulation of catalase activity is not well understood. In this study, we isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, no catalase activity1-3 (nca1-3) that is hypersensitive to many abiotic stress treatments. The mutated gene was identified by map-based cloning as NCA1, which encodes a protein containing an N-terminal RING-finger domain and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat-like helical domain. NCA1 interacts with and increases catalase activity maximally in a 240-kD complex in planta. In vitro, NCA1 interacts with CATALASE2 (CAT2) in a 1:1 molar ratio, and the NCA1 C terminus is essential for this interaction. CAT2 activity increased 10-fold in the presence of NCA1, and zinc ion binding of the NCA1 N terminus is required for this increase. NCA1 has chaperone protein activity that may maintain the folding of catalase in a functional state. NCA1 is a cytosol-located protein. Expression of NCA1 in the mitochondrion of the nca1-3 mutant does not rescue the abiotic stress phenotypes of the mutant, while expression in the cytosol or peroxisome does. Our results suggest that NCA1 is essential for catalase

Abstract Several proteins in plants build up the innate immune response system in plants which get triggered during the occurrence of biotic stress. Here we report the functional characterization of a glycine-rich proline-rich protein (SbGPRP1) from Sorghum which was previously demonstrated to be involved in abiotic stresses. Expression studies carried out with SbGPRP1 showed induced expression upon application of phytohormones like salicylic acid which might be the key in fine-tuning the expression level. Upon challenging the Sorghum plants with a compatible pathogen the SbGprp1 transcript was found to be upregulated. SbGPRP1 encodes a 197 amino acid polypeptide which was bacterially-expressed and purified for in vitro assays. Gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus and phytopathogen Rhodococcus fascians showed inhibited growth in the presence of the protein. The NPN assay, electrolytic leakage and SEM analysis showed membrane damage in bacterial cells. Ectopic expression of SbGPRP1 in tobacco plants led to enhanced tolerance towards infection caused by R. fascians. Though the N-terminal part of the protein showed disorderness the C-terminal end was quite capable of forming several α-helices which was correlated with CD spectroscopic analysis. Here, we have tried to determine the structural model for the protein and predicted the association of antimicrobial activity with the C-terminal region of the protein.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1007/s11103-019-00894-y","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Tanmoy","last_name":"Halder","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["Antimicrobial peptide","Rhodococcus fascians","Glycine-rich proline-rich protein","Bacterial membrane protein","YszA protein","LC–MS/MS","Dehydrin","Radical scavenging","Sorghum bicolor","Abnormal migration","Protease resistivity","Physcomitrella patens","Desiccation stress","Cold stress","Antimicrobial property","Overexpression","Lactate dehydrogenase","protein aggregation","High Temperature Stress","osmotic stress","Oxidative Stress","methyl viologen","electron transport chain","protoplast","Biotic stress","Scanning electron microscopy","Transgenic plant"]},{"first_name":"Gouranga","last_name":"Upadhyaya","affiliations":[],"email":"gour.cubot@gmail.com","orcid":"","h_index":7,"keywords":["Antimicrobial peptide","Rhodococcus fascians","Glycine-rich proline-rich protein","Bacterial membrane protein","YszA protein","LC–MS/MS","Dehydrin","Physcomitrella patens","Desiccation stress","Cold stress","Antimicrobial property","Overexpression","Lactate dehydrogenase","protein aggregation","High Temperature Stress","osmotic stress","Oxidative Stress","methyl viologen","electron transport chain","protoplast","Biotic stress","Scanning electron microscopy","Transgenic plant","amphipathic α-helix","high-temperature stress","dehydrin–dehydrin interaction","self-association","cell survivability","nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)","intrinsically disordered protein","poikilohydric plant","D-segment","BiFC","bimolecular fluorescence complementation","DHN","IDP","LDH","LEA","late embryogenesis abundant","MDA","PpNBS1","ROS detoxification","Physcomitrium"]},{"first_name":"Sudipta","last_name":"Ray","affiliations":[],"email":"srbot@caluniv.ac.in","orcid":"","h_index":7,"keywords":["Dehydrin","Radical scavenging","Sorghum bicolor","Abnormal migration","Protease resistivity","Physcomitrella patens","Desiccation stress","Cold stress","Antimicrobial property","Overexpression","Dipcadi","karyotype","fluorochrome banding","DAPI bands","CMA bands","Antimicrobial peptide","Biotic stress","Glycine-rich proline-rich protein","Rhodococcus fascians","Scanning electron microscopy","Transgenic plant","amphipathic α-helix","high-temperature stress","dehydrin–dehydrin interaction","protein aggregation","self-association","cell survivability","nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)","intrinsically disordered protein","poikilohydric plant","D-segment","BiFC","bimolecular fluorescence complementation","DHN","IDP","LDH","lactate dehydrogenase","LEA","late embryogenesis abundant","MDA","PpNBS1","Oxidative stress","ROS detoxification","Physcomitrium","Bacterial membrane protein","YszA protein","LC–MS/MS","Physcomitrium patens","DNA damage","Chloroplastic RecA","Homologous recombination"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":66,"location":null,"raw_text":"Halder, T.; Upadhyaya, G.; Roy, S.; Biswas, R.; Das, A.; Bagchi, A.; Agarwal, T.; Ray, S.

GPRPs are relatively short peptides (<200 amino acids) that contain three typical domains, including an N-terminal XYPP-repeat domain, a middle hydrophobic domain rich in alanine, and a C-terminal HGK-repeat domain. These proteins have been proposed to play fundamental roles in plant growth and environmental adaptation, but their functions remain unknown. In this study, we selected an Arabidopsis GPRP (AtGPRP3) to profile the physiological role of GPRPs. Transcripts of AtGPRP3 could be detected in the whole Arabidopsis plant, but greater amounts were found in the rosette, followed by the cauline. The AtGPRP3::GFP fusion protein was mainly localized in the nucleus. The overexpression and knockout of AtGPRP3, respectively, retarded and accelerated the growth of Arabidopsis seedlings, while the increase in the growth rate of atgprp3 plants was offset by the complementary expression of AtGPRP3. CAT2 and CAT3, but not CAT1, interacted with AtGPRP3 in the nuclei of Arabidopsis protoplasts. The knockout of CAT2 by CRISPR-Cas9 retarded the growth of the Arabidopsis seedlings. Together, our data suggest that AtGPRP3 negatively regulates plant growth, potentially through CAT2 and CAT3.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.3390/ijms21176168","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Xiaojing","last_name":"Liu","affiliations":[],"email":"407311416073@email.ncu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Arabidopsis","glycine- and proline-rich protein","protein interaction","seedling growth"]},{"first_name":"Xin","last_name":"Wang","affiliations":[],"email":"wangxin@ncu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":10,"keywords":["1-Naphthaleneacetic acid","ABA","Abscisic acid","BAC","Bacterial artificial chromosomes","Basic leucine zipper","Cis-element","DAP","DNA binding with one finger","DOF","Days after pollination","Endosperm-specific expression","Endosperm-specific gene","Expression profile","FAA","Formalin–acetic acid–alcohol","Gene ontology","Genome","Gibberellin","IAA","Heat tolerance","Protein disulfide isomerase","MtPDI","Transgenic rice","OsDCL3b","Pollen fertility","Seed-setting rate","Grain yield","Grain quality","Small RNA","OsHSP40","Oryza sativa","Abiotic stress","Expression pattern","Function analysis","OsGPRP3","grain size and shape","CRISPR","seed storage substance","fructokinase","OsFRK3","starch","grain filling","RNAi","OsAT1","accumulation","anion","regulates","transporter","rice","grain size","RAG2","seed storage proteins","grain weight","OsIPCS","Gene family","Sphingolipid","Plant growth","Metabolism","PcG","seed development","imprinted gene","aleurone layer","seed germination","lipid transfer protein","CRISPR and RNAi","agronomic traits","spikelet hulls","cell","proliferation","ω-3 fatty acid desaturase","GmFAD3A","cold stress","Arabidopsis","glycine- and proline-rich protein","protein interaction","seedling growth","AUX","OsIAA29","Seed specific expression","Heat stress"]},{"first_name":"Xin","last_name":"Yan","affiliations":[],"email":"xinyan@ncu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["Arabidopsis","glycine- and proline-rich protein","protein interaction","seedling growth"]},{"first_name":"Shaobo","last_name":"Li","affiliations":[],"email":"lishaobo@ncu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":6,"keywords":["OsHSP40","Oryza sativa","Abiotic stress","Expression pattern","Function analysis","Nitrogen use efficiency","Rice","fertility","identification","Micrornas Associated","OsIPCS","Gene family","Sphingolipid","Plant growth","Metabolism","ω-3 fatty acid desaturase","GmFAD3A","cold stress","seed germination","Germination","Grain size","OsLTPL18","Seed storage substances","OsDCL3b","Pollen fertility","Seed-setting rate","Grain yield","Grain quality","Small RNA","Arabidopsis","glycine- and proline-rich protein","protein interaction","seedling growth"]},{"first_name":"Hui","last_name":"Peng","affiliations":[],"email":"huipeng@ucdavis.edu","orcid":"","h_index":3,"keywords":["Eggplant","Hydroxycinnamic acid amide","Spermine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase","Substrate specificity","Crop improvement","Solanum richardii","Phytochemicals","Broad-sense heritability","Browning","Lettuce stem","Romaine lettuce","Arabidopsis","glycine- and proline-rich protein","protein interaction","seedling growth"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":67,"location":null,"raw_text":"Liu, X.; Wang, X.; Yan, X.; Li, S.; Peng, H.

However, there are still no detailed studies investigating the response of nitric oxide (NO) to the different nitrogen nutrition and water regimes. To study the intrinsic mechanism underpinning this relationship, the time-dependent production of NO and its protective role in the antioxidant defense system of NH4+- or NO3-supplied rice seedlings were studied under water stress. An early NO burst was induced by 3 h of water stress in the roots of seedlings subjected to NH4+ treatment, but this phenomenon was not observed under NO3 treatment. Root oxidative damage induced by water stress was significantly higher for treatment with NO3 than with NH4+ due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the former. Inducing NO production by applying the NO donor 3 h after NO3 treatment alleviated the oxidative damage, while inhibiting the early NO burst by applying the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO) increased root oxidative damage in NH4+ treatment. Application of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(L-NAME) completely suppressed NO synthesis in roots 3 h after NH4+ treatment and aggravated water stress-induced oxidative damage. Therefore, the aggravation of oxidative damage by L-NAME might have resulted from changes in the NOS-mediated early NO burst. Water stress also increased the activity of root antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and ascorbate peroxidase). These were further induced by the NO donor but repressed by the NO scavenger and NOS inhibitor in NH4+-treated roots. These findings demonstrate that the NOS-mediated early NO burst plays an important role in alleviating oxidative damage induced by water stress by enhancing the antioxidant defenses in roots supplemented with NH4+.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1186/s12870-019-1721-2","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Xiao Chuang","last_name":"Cao","affiliations":[],"email":"caoxiaochuang@126.com","orcid":"","h_index":14,"keywords":["Ammonium","Glycine","Hexavalent chromium stress","Nitrate","Pak choi","Uptake and metabolism","A. brasilense","Enzyme activity","N transformation","P. fluorescens","Rice biomass","Rice rhizosphere","Mixed-nitrogen","Photosynthesis","Carbon partitioning","Hormone balance","Water stress","Early seedling growth","Oryza sativa","physiology","rice","sodium chloride","Water and nitrogen interaction","Alternate wetting and drying","Yield","Controlled-release/stable N fertilizers","AWD irrigation","Agronomic characteristics","Nitrogen use efficiency","Grain yield","ACS activity","Ethylene","Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate","Salinity","1-Methylcyclopropene","Ethephon","Seed priming","Brassica chinensis","Glucose","Nitrogen uptake","Rhizodeposition","Soil nutrients","Abscisic acid","Proline metabolism","Root oxidative damage","Hypoxic stress","Salt stress","proteomics","iTRAQ quantification","cell membrane injury","root activity","Soil adsorbed glycine","Glycine uptake","Glycine bioavailability","Sterile cultivation","S158.5","吸附态氨基酸","铵态氮","甘氨酸生物有效性","无菌培养","optimize","nitrogen fertilizer","sup","rice yield","rice grain","kg N ha","Leaf N allocation","Water deficit stress","Photosynthetic N-Use efficiency","Limiting factor","Oryza sativa L","nitrogen","mixed","leaf","nutrition regimes","drought","Amino acids","Cold stress","Nitrogen form","Physiological trait","stress","treatment","early NO burst","supplied rice","oxidative damage","sub","Aeration","Glutamate dehydrogenase","Glutamate","Glutamate synthase","Ammonia","aluminum toxicity","Hydrogen Sulfide","Cell Wall","Root elongation","Gene Expression","Antioxidant Enzymes","Hydrogen peroxide","phosphorus","pectin","nitric oxide","Hemicellulose","Iron","Remobilization","Transport","Aluminum","Boron","Pectin methylesterase","H2O2","Genes","alkaline soils","control-release fertilizer","micronutrient","biofortification","expression of genes","toxicity","suppressing ethylene emissions","PME","downregulating","OsNRAT1","Cadmium","Putrescine","biochar","soil properties","bacteria","early and late rice","N uptake","N use efficiency","rice-soil system","15N isotopic labelling","phytohormone","SPAD value","Nitric oxide synthase"]},{"first_name":"Chunquan","last_name":"Zhu","affiliations":[],"email":"1035305743@qq.com","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Ammonium","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Water stress"]},{"first_name":"Chu","last_name":"Zhong","affiliations":[],"email":"526996703@qq.com","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Ammonium","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Water stress"]},{"first_name":"Junhua","last_name":"Zhang","affiliations":[],"email":"situyajie@126.com","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["Abscisic acid","Proline metabolism","Root oxidative damage","Hypoxic stress","Rice","Ammonium","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Water stress"]},{"first_name":"Lianghuan","last_name":"Wu","affiliations":[],"email":"517869546@qq.com","orcid":"","h_index":1,"keywords":["Ammonium","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Water stress"]},{"first_name":"Qianyu","last_name":"Jin","affiliations":[],"email":"11014041@zju.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":5,"keywords":["Oryza sativa","Water and nitrogen interaction","Alternate wetting and drying","Photosynthesis","Yield","Mixed-nitrogen","Carbon partitioning","Hormone balance","Water stress","Ammonium","Nitrogen metabolism","Gene transcription","Rice","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Aeration","Glutamate dehydrogenase","Glutamate","Glutamate synthase","Ammonia","Nitrate","Spatial distribution","composition","amino acids","inorganic N","Chinese agricultural soils","15N-glycine","amino acid uptake","nutritional contribution","sterile hydroponics"]},{"first_name":"Qianyu","last_name":"Jin","affiliations":[],"email":"592214410@qq.com","orcid":"","h_index":2,"keywords":["Ammonium","Nitric oxide","Nitric oxide synthase","Oxidative damage","Antioxidant enzymes","Water stress","Spatial distribution","composition","amino acids","inorganic N","Chinese agricultural soils"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":68,"location":null,"raw_text":"Cao, X.; Zhu, C.; Zhong, C.; Zhang, J.; Wu, L.; Jin, Q.; Ma, Q.

However, there is still little information concerning toxicity of chromium (Cr) to tall fescue and roles of nitric oxide (NO) in plants against Cr(VI) stress. In this study, different Cr(VI) treatments (0, 1, 5 and 10 mg/L Cr(VI)) and NO treatments were applied with different combinations in hydroponics culture and their interactions to tall fescue were studied. Specifically, 100 µM sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 100 µM NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) treatments were used to apply exogenous NO or inhibit synthesis of NO respectively. Our results showed that tall fescue exhibits comparable Cr(VI) tolerance as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Additionally, Cr(VI) accumulation in tall fescue leaves were carefully studied and discussed. Moreover, we observed the significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents of tall fescue when subjected to Cr(VI) stress, as well as decreased photosynthetic activities induced by Cr(VI) stress by methods of chlorophyll a fluorescence transient, slow chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics and rapid light response curves. Decreased behaviors of photosynthetic activities may due to destruction of antennae pigments by Cr(VI), ROS burst induced by Cr(VI), and down regulation of photosystem II (PSII) by non-photochemical quenching to avoid over reduction of quinone A, which could be considered as an important strategy to cope with Cr(VI) stress. Meanwhile, exogenous NO treatment improves overall physiological and photosynthetic behaviors of tall fescue against Cr(VI) stress. Moreover, increased translocation factors and improved Cr(VI) tolerance of plants under exogenous NO treatment suggest that SNP treatment could be a useful application for Cr phytoremediation.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.07.118","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Ke","last_name":"Chen","affiliations":[],"email":"kechen@mail.scuec.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":12,"keywords":["Phytoremediation","Abiotic stress","Nitric oxide","Fluorescence transient","treatments","apoptosis","tall fescue","contaminants","acceptor sides","photosystem","Cd stress","RNA-Seq","Molecular mechanism","Chromium","Reactive oxygen species","Photosystem II","Toxicity","Labile soil aluminum fractions","Aluminum species","Al-F- complexes","Soil labile aluminum fractions","Bacterial community","Acidic soils","Cadmium-contaminated soil","Dynamic characteristics","Microbiome","Indian mustard","Phytic acid","Abiotic dephosphorylation","Organic phosphate recovery","Iron complexes catalysts","Ferryl-based mechanism","biochar","supercapacitor","organic pollutant","peroxydisulfate","free radicals","non-radical pathway","Short- and long-term heat stress","Senescence","SMRT and Illumina RNA-Seq","Responsive genes","Alternative splicing","Metabolite profiling","Detoxification mechanism","PAHs","Naphthalene","Chlorophyll fluorescence","Mass spectrometry","behavior","SIAM","sup","pyrene","metabolomics","isotopic","environmental contaminants","structural","TPs","Phytohormones","Strengthening strategy","Cadmium","Lead","Root architecture","Carboxyl groups","Bisphenol S","Mineralization","Degradation","Bound residue","Transformation products"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":69,"location":null,"raw_text":"Huang, M.; Ai, H.; Xu, X.; Chen, K.; Niu, H.; Zhu, H.; Sun, J.; Du, D.; Chen, L.
