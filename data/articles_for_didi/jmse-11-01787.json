The external excitations include the current-induced hydrodynamic forces and the wave-induced motions of the floating platform, while the internal excitation refers to the effect of internal flow. With significant increase of the riser aspect ratio, the VIV becomes much more complicated, resulting in more frequent fatigue damages to the risers. Hence, VIV is an important research area in marine engineering. This review surveys the latest progress on the VIV research, including the multi-mode response, VIV response at high Reynolds numbers, flow-induced vibrations between multiple marine risers, VIV of inclined risers and intermittent VIV in oscillatory flow. Particularly, the impacts of the floating platform and internal flow that have not been widely considered in previous studies are discussed to comprehensively understand the VIV of marine risers. Moreover, typical experimental and numerical investigations on the VIV of marine risers are also introduced.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2019.106704","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Guijie","last_name":"Liu","affiliations":[],"email":"","orcid":"","h_index":16,"keywords":["Multi-objective

In real sea conditions, risers simultaneously encounter waves and flow. A general analysis considers only parametric excitation resulting from platform motions or vortex-shedding excitation due to flow bypassing the risers. However, the instability of a TTR under combined excitations can lead to fatigue damage; therefore it is essential to explore the dynamic characteristics in order to maintain the safety and avoid accidents. A derived TTR model subjected to multi-frequency parametric and vortex shedding excitation has been proposed, and different cases of excitation combinations were compared. The effects of key design parameters on the dynamic properties of a TTR under combined excitation are discussed. The surface distribution of instability for a TTR system under multi-frequency parametric and vortex-shedding excitations was analyzed on the basis of various significant wave height and wave peak period combinations, and extreme sea states were considered to determine the maximum strength of a TTR. Several interesting phenomena were observed. The instability of a TTR system excited by combined excitation could be more unstable than that excited only by parametric excitation or vortex-shedding excitation. It can be concluded that the effect of vortex shedding is predominant in the excited instability of a TTR under combined excitation when the outside sea state is mild, but when the sea states is severe, parametric excitation contributes more to the instability, vortex-shedding excitation only strengthens the consequent instability. More modes and a higher frequency of vibration can be excited when extreme states are more severe.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2014.02.006","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Hezhen","last_name":"Yang","affiliations":[],"email":"yanghz@sjtu.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":11,"keywords":["design optimization","Bending Stiffener","Fatigue Reliability Based","optimization","genetic algorithm","steel catenary riser","deepwater","touch down point","finite element method",": Damage","Decomposition","framed structures","Localization","modal analysis","Strain energy","Stress","Fatigue analysis","Steel catenary risers","Steel","resonance","hulls","parametric resonance","stability analysis","instability","ocean waves","metamodel","Genetic algorithms","Pareto optimization","Robust Requirements","model","offshore wind turbine","irregular waves","DDS","chart","parametric pitch","Underwater drilling","Event history analysis","Pipeline risers","deep-sea riser","parametric excitation","vibration response","Reliability","reliability-based optimizationsteel catenary riserdynamic analysismetamodel","monte carlo simulation","material properties","finite element analysis","dynamic analysis","optimization problem","optimal design","sensitivity analysis","properties of materials","parametric analysis","uncertainty","riser","structural","SLWR","fatigue life","wave","lazy","catenary","nonlinearity","stress joint","reel-lay","weld defect","multiaxial fatigue","installation","pipeline","Multi-objective optimization","Approximation Model","decision-making","dynamic umbilical","Fatigue","Cable reels","knowledge-based engineering","ship design","knowledge base","optimisation","vibration","DAMAGE DETECTION","Structures","damage localization","Marine Risers","Response Signals","Rdo","supporting structures","Vortex-induced vibrations","Mathieu","Multi-frequency","unbonded flexible riser","P 751","parametric instability","parametric rolling","Ince-Strutt stability chart","Submerged floating pipelines","vortex-induced oscillations","dynamic instability","Vortex-induced vibration","Dynamic response","Mathieu equation"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":5,"location":null,"raw_text":"Yang, H.; Xiao, F.

In this paper, 36 experimental cases were investigated to study the risers VIV characteristics due to the combination of multiple parameters. The natural frequencies, response microstrains and frequencies of VIV for the risers were obtained. Meanwhile, the effect of each parameter and the relative significance of these parameters on the amplitude of VIV in risers were calculated using grey relational analysis (GRA).

The design of composite risers consists of two stages: (1) local design based on critical local load cases (LCs) to obtain the geometric configuration of the riser which will be analysed in the global design stage, and (2) global analysis of the full length composite riser under global loads including top tension force, platform motion, hydrostatic pressure, gravity, buoyancy, wave and current loads to determine and assess critical locations. This study describes the methodology, LCs, analysis procedure and results of the global design of the composite riser based on the geometries of the tubular optimised in the local design stage. The results show that a careful local design of the tubular using inclined reinforcements in addition to axial and hoop reinforcements can offer substantial weight savings and at the same time ensure that the structure is capable of withstanding the global loads applied on it.","citations":[],"section":"","section_number":"0","position":0,"location":null}],"keywords":[],"doi":"10.1080/09243046.2015.1052187","body":[],"figures":[],"tables":[],"references":[],"annexes":[],"authors":[{"first_name":"Chunguang","last_name":"Wang","affiliations":[],"email":"cgwang@sdut.edu.cn","orcid":"","h_index":8,"keywords":["composite riser","FRP composite material design","offshore engineering","finite element modelling","global design","Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm","design optimisation","functional","Extreme","steel","fibre","structural","reinforced","Weight Saving","Composite Risers","structural optimization","Genetic Algorithm","single-objective","multi-objective","horizontal thrust","FRP composite riser","vortex-induced vibration","coupled fluid–structure interaction","CFD simulation","pipeline","marine riser","marine composite","marine structures","composite structures","advanced composite material","thermoplastic composite pipes (TCP)","fibre-reinforced composites (FRP)","hybrid composite structures","review","tailored local design","finite element model (FEM)","marine pipeline risers","composite marine structures","numerical modelling","stress","saline soil","corroded concrete","time-dependent","compressive strength","corrosion effects","monitoring","offshore platform","flexible riser","riser","guidelines","cement grouting materials","effect mechanisms","early strength","reinforced concrete","nano-SiO2","toner","cement mortar","degradation mechanisms","magnesium sulfate","corrosion","hydration reaction","dynamic response","wave-induced vibration","coupling effect of multiparameter","local design"]}],"language":"en","funding":[],"conflicts_of_interest":[]},"position":17,"location":null,"raw_text":"Wang, C.; Shankar, K.; Morozov, E.V.
